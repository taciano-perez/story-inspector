SHERLOCK HOLMES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the\r\nUniversity of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course\r\nprescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there,\r\nI was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant\r\nSurgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before\r\nI could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at\r\nBombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and\r\nwas already deep in the enemy\u2019s country. I followed, however, with many\r\nother officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded\r\nin reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once\r\nentered upon my new duties.\r\n\r\nThe campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had\r\nnothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and\r\nattached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of\r\nMaiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which\r\nshattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have\r\nfallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the\r\ndevotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a\r\npack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.\r\n\r\nWorn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had\r\nundergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to\r\nthe base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved\r\nso far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little\r\nupon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse\r\nof our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and\r\nwhen at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak and\r\nemaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost\r\nin sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the\r\ntroopship \u201cOrontes,\u201d and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with\r\nmy health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal\r\ngovernment to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.\r\n\r\nI had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as\r\nair--or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will\r\npermit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to\r\nLondon, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of\r\nthe Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at\r\na private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless\r\nexistence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely\r\nthan I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that\r\nI soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate\r\nsomewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in\r\nmy style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making\r\nup my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less\r\npretentious and less expensive domicile.\r\n\r\nOn the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at\r\nthe Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning\r\nround I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at\r\nBarts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is\r\na pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had never\r\nbeen a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm,\r\nand he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In the\r\nexuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn, and\r\nwe started off together in a hansom.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?\u201d he asked in\r\nundisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.\r\n\u201cYou are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.\u201d\r\n\r\nI gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it\r\nby the time that we reached our destination.\r\n\r\n\u201cPoor'), NULL);

He is a little queer\r\nin his ideas--an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I\r\nknow he is a decent fellow enough.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA medical student, I suppose?\u201d said I.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo--I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well\r\nup in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know,\r\nhe has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are\r\nvery desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the way\r\nknowledge which would astonish his professors.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you never ask him what he was going in for?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be\r\ncommunicative enough when the fancy seizes him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should like to meet him,\u201d I said. \u201cIf I am to lodge with anyone, I\r\nshould prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong\r\nenough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in\r\nAfghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How\r\ncould I meet this friend of yours?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is sure to be at the laboratory,\u201d returned my companion. \u201cHe either\r\navoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to\r\nnight. If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other\r\nchannels.\r\n\r\nAs we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford\r\ngave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to\r\ntake as a fellow-lodger.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou mustn\u2019t blame me if you don\u2019t get on with him,\u201d he said; \u201cI know\r\nnothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in\r\nthe laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold me\r\nresponsible.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t get on it will be easy to part company,\u201d I answered. \u201cIt\r\nseems to me, Stamford,\u201d I added, looking hard at my companion, \u201cthat you\r\nhave some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this fellow\u2019s\r\ntemper so formidable, or what is it? Don\u2019t be mealy-mouthed about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is not easy to express the inexpressible,\u201d he answered with a laugh.\r\n\u201cHolmes is a little too scientific for my tastes--it approaches to\r\ncold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of\r\nthe latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you understand,\r\nbut simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea\r\nof the effects. To do him justice, I think that he would take it himself\r\nwith the same readiness. He appears to have a passion for definite and\r\nexact knowledge.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cVery right too.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating the\r\nsubjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking\r\nrather a bizarre shape.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBeating the subjects!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death.

It was familiar ground to me,\r\nand I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and\r\nmade our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed\r\nwall and dun-coloured doors. Near the further end a low arched passage\r\nbranched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory.\r\n\r\nThis was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles.\r\nBroad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts,\r\ntest-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames.\r\nThere was only one student in the room, who was bending over a distant\r\ntable absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he glanced round\r\nand sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. \u201cI\u2019ve found it! I\u2019ve\r\nfound it,\u201d he shouted to my companion, running towards us with a\r\ntest-tube in his hand. \u201cI have found a re-agent which is precipitated\r\nby hoemoglobin, [4] and by nothing else.\u201d Had he discovered a gold mine,\r\ngreater delight could not have shone upon his features.\r\n\r\n\u201cDr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\u201d said Stamford, introducing us.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow are you?\u201d he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength\r\nfor which I should hardly have given him credit. \u201cYou have been in\r\nAfghanistan, I perceive.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow on earth did you know that?\u201d I asked in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d said he, chuckling to himself. \u201cThe question now is about\r\nhoemoglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of\r\nmine?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is interesting, chemically, no doubt,\u201d I answered, \u201cbut\r\npractically----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years.\r\nDon\u2019t you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains. Come\r\nover here now!\u201d He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his eagerness, and\r\ndrew me over to the table at which he had been working. \u201cLet us have\r\nsome fresh blood,\u201d he said, digging a long bodkin into his finger, and\r\ndrawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette. \u201cNow, I\r\nadd this small quantity of blood to a litre of water. You perceive that\r\nthe resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water. The proportion\r\nof blood cannot be more than one in a million. I have no doubt, however,\r\nthat we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction.\u201d As he\r\nspoke, he threw into the vessel a few white crystals, and then added\r\nsome drops of a transparent fluid. In an instant the contents assumed a\r\ndull mahogany colour, and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom\r\nof the glass jar.\r\n\r\n\u201cHa! ha!\u201d he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a\r\nchild with a new toy. \u201cWhat do you think of that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems to be a very delicate test,\u201d I remarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cBeautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and\r\nuncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. The\r\nlatter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this appears\r\nto act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test been\r\ninvented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who would long\r\nago have paid the penalty of their crimes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed!\u201d I murmured.\r\n\r\n\u201cCriminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is\r\nsuspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His\r\nlinen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon them.\r\nAre they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit stains,\r\nor what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many an expert,\r\nand why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have the Sherlock\r\nHolmes\u2019 test, and there will no longer be any difficulty.\u201d\r\n\r\nHis eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his\r\nheart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are to be congratulated,\u201d I remarked, considerably surprised at his\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year.

What\r\nhave you to confess now? It\u2019s just as well for two fellows to know the\r\nworst of one another before they begin to live together.\u201d\r\n\r\nI laughed at this cross-examination. \u201cI keep a bull pup,\u201d I said, \u201cand\r\nI object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all sorts\r\nof ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another set of vices\r\nwhen I\u2019m well, but those are the principal ones at present.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDo you include violin-playing in your category of rows?\u201d he asked,\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt depends on the player,\u201d I answered. \u201cA well-played violin is a treat\r\nfor the gods--a badly-played one----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s all right,\u201d he cried, with a merry laugh. \u201cI think we may\r\nconsider the thing as settled--that is, if the rooms are agreeable to\r\nyou.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen shall we see them?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCall for me here at noon to-morrow, and we\u2019ll go together and settle\r\neverything,\u201d he answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll right--noon exactly,\u201d said I, shaking his hand.\r\n\r\nWe left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together towards\r\nmy hotel.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy the way,\u201d I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford, \u201chow\r\nthe deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?\u201d\r\n\r\nMy companion smiled an enigmatical smile. \u201cThat\u2019s just his little\r\npeculiarity,\u201d he said. \u201cA good many people have wanted to know how he\r\nfinds things out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh! a mystery is it?\u201d I cried, rubbing my hands. \u201cThis is very piquant.\r\nI am much obliged to you for bringing us together. \u2018The proper study of\r\nmankind is man,\u2019 you know.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou must study him, then,\u201d Stamford said, as he bade me good-bye.\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll find him a knotty problem, though.

They\r\nconsisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large\r\nairy sitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad\r\nwindows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so moderate\r\ndid the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain was\r\nconcluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession.\r\nThat very evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the\r\nfollowing '), NULL);

For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and\r\nlaying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we\r\ngradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\nHolmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet\r\nin his ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be\r\nup after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out\r\nbefore I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical\r\nlaboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and occasionally in long\r\nwalks, which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the City.\r\nNothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him; but\r\nnow and again a reaction would seize him, and for days on end he would\r\nlie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving\r\na muscle from morning to night. On these occasions I have noticed such\r\na dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected him\r\nof being addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance\r\nand cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion.\r\n\r\nAs the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his\r\naims in life, gradually deepened and increased. His very person and\r\nappearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual\r\nobserver. In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively\r\nlean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp and\r\npiercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have alluded;\r\nand his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air of\r\nalertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and squareness\r\nwhich mark the man of determination. His hands were invariably\r\nblotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was possessed of\r\nextraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had occasion to observe\r\nwhen I watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments.\r\n\r\nThe reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how\r\nmuch this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured\r\nto break through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned\r\nhimself. Before pronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered, how\r\nobjectless was my life, and how little there was to engage my attention.\r\nMy health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather was\r\nexceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would call upon me and\r\nbreak the monotony of my daily existence. Under these circumstances, I\r\neagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my companion, and\r\nspent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it.\r\n\r\nHe was not studying medicine. He had himself, in reply to a question,\r\nconfirmed Stamford\u2019s opinion upon that point. Neither did he appear to\r\nhave pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in\r\nscience or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance\r\ninto the learned world. Yet his zeal for certain studies was remarkable,\r\nand within eccentric limits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ample\r\nand minute that his observations have fairly astounded me. Surely no man\r\nwould work so hard or attain such precise information unless he had some\r\ndefinite end in view. Desultory readers are seldom remarkable for the\r\nexactness of their learning. No man burdens his mind with small matters\r\nunless he has some very good reason for doing so.\r\n\r\nHis ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporary\r\nliterature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing.\r\nUpon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired in the naivest way who he\r\nmight be and what he had done. My surprise reached a climax, however,\r\nwhen I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the Copernican Theory\r\nand of the composition of the Solar System.

Therefore all the knowledge which he\r\npossessed was such as would be useful to him. I enumerated in my own\r\nmind all the various points upon which he had shown me that he was\r\nexceptionally well-informed.

Clearly they\r\nreflected the thoughts which possessed him, but whether the music aided\r\nthose thoughts, or whether the playing was simply the result of a whim\r\nor fancy was more than I could determine. I might have rebelled against\r\nthese exasperating solos had it not been that he usually terminated them\r\nby playing in quick succession a whole series of my favourite airs as a\r\nslight compensation for the trial upon my patience.\r\n\r\nDuring the first week or so we had no callers, and I had begun to think\r\nthat my companion was as friendless a man as I was myself. Presently,\r\nhowever, I found that he had many acquaintances, and those in the most\r\ndifferent classes of society. There was one little sallow rat-faced,\r\ndark-eyed fellow who was introduced to me as Mr. Lestrade, and who came\r\nthree or four times in a single week. One morning a young girl called,\r\nfashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour or more. The same\r\nafternoon brought a grey-headed, seedy visitor, looking like a Jew\r\npedlar, who appeared to me to be much excited, and who was closely\r\nfollowed by a slip-shod elderly woman. On another occasion an old\r\nwhite-haired gentleman had an interview with my companion; and on\r\nanother a railway porter in his velveteen uniform. When any of these\r\nnondescript individuals put in an appearance, Sherlock Holmes used to\r\nbeg for the use of the sitting-room, and I would retire to my bed-room.\r\nHe always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience. \u201cI have\r\nto use this room as a place of business,\u201d he said, \u201cand these people\r\nare my clients.\u201d Again I had an opportunity of asking him a point blank\r\nquestion, and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing another man to\r\nconfide in me. I imagined at the time that he had some strong reason for\r\nnot alluding to it, but he soon dispelled the idea by coming round to\r\nthe subject of his own accord.\r\n\r\nIt was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that I\r\nrose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes had not\r\nyet finished his breakfast. The landlady had become so accustomed to my\r\nlate habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared. With\r\nthe unreasonable petulance of mankind I rang the bell and gave a curt\r\nintimation that I was ready. Then I picked up a magazine from the table\r\nand attempted to while away the time with it, while my companion munched\r\nsilently at his toast. One of the articles had a pencil mark at the\r\nheading, and I naturally began to run my eye through it.\r\n\r\nIts somewhat ambitious title was \u201cThe Book of Life,\u201d and it attempted to\r\nshow how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic\r\nexamination of all that came in his way. It struck me as being a\r\nremarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. The reasoning was\r\nclose and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to be far-fetched\r\nand exaggerated. The writer claimed by a momentary expression, a twitch\r\nof a muscle or a glance of an eye, to fathom a man\u2019s inmost thoughts.\r\nDeceit, according to him, was an impossibility in the case of one\r\ntrained to observation and analysis. His conclusions were as infallible\r\nas so many propositions of Euclid. So startling would his results appear\r\nto the uninitiated that until they learned the processes by which he had\r\narrived at them they might well consider him as a necromancer.\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom a drop of water,\u201d said the writer, \u201ca logician could infer the\r\npossibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of\r\none or the other. So all life is a great chain, the nature of which is\r\nknown whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all other arts,\r\nthe Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired\r\nby long and patient study nor is life long enough to allow any mortal\r\nto attain the highest possible perfection in it.

I don\u2019t deny that it is smartly written. It irritates me though. It\r\nis evidently the theory of some arm-chair lounger who evolves all these\r\nneat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own study. It is not\r\npractical. I should like to see him clapped down in a third class\r\ncarriage on the Underground, and asked to give the trades of all his\r\nfellow-travellers. I would lay a thousand to one against him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou would lose your money,\u201d Sherlock Holmes remarked calmly. \u201cAs for\r\nthe article I wrote it myself.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I have a turn both for observation and for deduction. The\r\ntheories which I have expressed there, and which appear to you to be so\r\nchimerical are really extremely practical--so practical that I depend\r\nupon them for my bread and cheese.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd how?\u201d I asked involuntarily.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the\r\nworld. I\u2019m a consulting detective, if you can understand what that is.\r\nHere in London we have lots of Government detectives and lots of private\r\nones. When these fellows are at fault they come to me, and I manage to\r\nput them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence before me, and I\r\nam generally able, by the help of my knowledge of the history of\r\ncrime, to set them straight. There is a strong family resemblance about\r\nmisdeeds, and if you have all the details of a thousand at your finger\r\nends, it is odd if you can\u2019t unravel the thousand and first. Lestrade\r\nis a well-known detective. He got himself into a fog recently over a\r\nforgery case, and that was what brought him here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd these other people?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies. They are\r\nall people who are in trouble about something, and want a little\r\nenlightening. I listen to their story, they listen to my comments, and\r\nthen I pocket my fee.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut do you mean to say,\u201d I said, \u201cthat without leaving your room you\r\ncan unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although they\r\nhave seen every detail for themselves?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a case\r\nturns up which is a little more complex. Then I have to bustle about and\r\nsee things with my own eyes. You see I have a lot of special knowledge\r\nwhich I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters wonderfully.\r\nThose rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused your\r\nscorn, are invaluable to me in practical work. Observation with me is\r\nsecond nature.

Clearly in Afghanistan.\u2019 The\r\nwhole train of thought did not occupy a second. I then remarked that you\r\ncame from Afghanistan, and you were astonished.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is simple enough as you explain it,\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cYou remind\r\nme of Edgar Allen Poe\u2019s Dupin.

That trick of his of breaking\r\nin on his friends\u2019 thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter of\r\nan hour\u2019s silence is really very showy and superficial.

That book made me positively ill. The question was\r\nhow to identify an unknown prisoner. I could have done it in twenty-four\r\nhours. Lecoq took six months or so. It might be made a text-book for\r\ndetectives to teach them what to avoid.\u201d\r\n\r\nI felt rather indignant at having two characters whom I had admired\r\ntreated in this cavalier style. I walked over to the window, and stood\r\nlooking out into the busy street. \u201cThis fellow may be very clever,\u201d I\r\nsaid to myself, \u201cbut he is certainly very conceited.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are no crimes and no criminals in these days,\u201d he said,\r\nquerulously. \u201cWhat is the use of having brains in our profession. I know\r\nwell that I have it in me to make my name famous. No man lives or has\r\never lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural\r\ntalent to the detection of crime which I have done. And what is the\r\nresult? There is no crime to detect, or, at most, some bungling villainy\r\nwith a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard official can see\r\nthrough it.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation. I thought it\r\nbest to change the topic.\r\n\r\n\u201cI wonder what that fellow is looking for?\u201d I asked, pointing to a\r\nstalwart, plainly-dressed individual who was walking slowly down the\r\nother side of the street, looking anxiously at the numbers. He had\r\na large blue envelope in his hand, and was evidently the bearer of a\r\nmessage.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou mean the retired sergeant of Marines,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cBrag and bounce!\u201d thought I to myself. \u201cHe knows that I cannot verify\r\nhis guess.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were\r\nwatching caught sight of the number on our door, and ran rapidly across\r\nthe roadway.

SHERLOCK HOLMES,--\r\n\r\n\u201cThere has been a bad business during the night at 3, Lauriston Gardens,\r\noff the Brixton Road. Our man on the beat saw a light there about two in\r\nthe morning, and as the house was an empty one, suspected that something\r\nwas amiss. He found the door open, and in the front room, which is bare\r\nof furniture, discovered the body of a gentleman, well dressed, and\r\nhaving cards in his pocket bearing the name of \u2018Enoch J. Drebber,\r\nCleveland, Ohio, U.S.A.\u2019 There had been no robbery, nor is there any\r\nevidence as to how the man met his death. There are marks of blood in\r\nthe room, but there is no wound upon his person. We are at a loss as to\r\nhow he came into the empty house; indeed, the whole affair is a puzzler.\r\nIf you can come round to the house any time before twelve, you will find\r\nme there. I have left everything _in statu quo_ until I hear from you.\r\nIf you are unable to come I shall give you fuller details, and would\r\nesteem it a great kindness if you would favour me with your opinion.\r\nYours faithfully,\r\n\r\n\u201cTOBIAS GREGSON.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cGregson is the smartest of the Scotland Yarders,\u201d my friend remarked;\r\n\u201che and Lestrade are the pick of a bad lot. They are both quick and\r\nenergetic, but conventional--shockingly so. They have their knives\r\ninto one another, too. They are as jealous as a pair of professional\r\nbeauties. There will be some fun over this case if they are both put\r\nupon the scent.\u201d\r\n\r\nI was amazed at the calm way in which he rippled on. \u201cSurely there is\r\nnot a moment to be lost,\u201d I cried, \u201cshall I go and order you a cab?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure about whether I shall go.

My companion was in the best of spirits, and prattled away\r\nabout Cremona fiddles, and the difference between a Stradivarius and\r\nan Amati. As for myself, I was silent, for the dull weather and the\r\nmelancholy business upon which we were engaged, depressed my spirits.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to give much thought to the matter in hand,\u201d I said at\r\nlast, interrupting Holmes\u2019 musical disquisition.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo data yet,\u201d he answered. \u201cIt is a capital mistake to theorize before\r\nyou have all the evidence.

Stop, driver, stop!\u201d We were still a hundred yards or so from\r\nit, but he insisted upon our alighting, and we finished our journey upon\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nNumber 3, Lauriston Gardens wore an ill-omened and minatory look. It was\r\none of four which stood back some little way from the street, two being\r\noccupied and two empty. The latter looked out with three tiers of vacant\r\nmelancholy windows, which were blank and dreary, save that here and\r\nthere a \u201cTo Let\u201d card had developed like a cataract upon the bleared\r\npanes. A small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption of sickly\r\nplants separated each of these houses from the street, and was traversed\r\nby a narrow pathway, yellowish in colour, and consisting apparently of a\r\nmixture of clay and of gravel. The whole place was very sloppy from the\r\nrain which had fallen through the night. The garden was bounded by a\r\nthree-foot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the top, and\r\nagainst this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable, surrounded by\r\na small knot of loafers, who craned their necks and strained their eyes\r\nin the vain hope of catching some glimpse of the proceedings within.\r\n\r\nI had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the\r\nhouse and plunged into a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared to be\r\nfurther from his intention. With an air of nonchalance which, under the\r\ncircumstances, seemed to me to border upon affectation, he lounged up\r\nand down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, the\r\nopposite houses and the line of railings. Having finished his scrutiny,\r\nhe proceeded slowly down the path, or rather down the fringe of grass\r\nwhich flanked the path, keeping his eyes riveted upon the ground. Twice\r\nhe stopped, and once I saw him smile, and heard him utter an exclamation\r\nof satisfaction. There were many marks of footsteps upon the wet clayey\r\nsoil, but since the police had been coming and going over it, I was\r\nunable to see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it.\r\nStill I had had such extraordinary evidence of the quickness of his\r\nperceptive faculties, that I had no doubt that he could see a great deal\r\nwhich was hidden from me.\r\n\r\nAt the door of the house we were met by a tall, white-faced,\r\nflaxen-haired man, with a notebook in his hand, who rushed forward and\r\nwrung my companion\u2019s hand with effusion. \u201cIt is indeed kind of you to\r\ncome,\u201d he said, \u201cI have had everything left untouched.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cExcept that!\u201d my friend answered, pointing at the pathway. \u201cIf a herd\r\nof buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess. No\r\ndoubt, however, you had drawn your own conclusions, Gregson, before you\r\npermitted this.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have had so much to do inside the house,\u201d the detective said\r\nevasively. \u201cMy colleague, Mr. Lestra'), NULL);

I had relied upon him\r\nto look after this.\u201d\r\n\r\nHolmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically. \u201cWith two\r\nsuch men as yourself and Lestrade upon the ground, there will not be\r\nmuch for a third party to find out,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\nGregson rubbed his hands in a self-satisfied way. \u201cI think we have done\r\nall that can be done,\u201d he answered; \u201cit\u2019s a queer case though, and I\r\nknew your taste for such things.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou did not come here in a cab?\u201d asked Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNor Lestrade?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen let us go and look at the room.\u201d With which inconsequent remark he\r\nstrode on into the house, followed by Gregson, whose features expressed\r\nhis astonishment.\r\n\r\nA short passage, bare planked and dusty, led to the kitchen and offices.\r\nTwo doors opened out of it to the left and to the right. One of these\r\nhad obviously been closed for many weeks. The other belonged to the\r\ndining-room, which was the apartment in which the mysterious affair had\r\noccurred. Holmes walked in, and I followed him with that subdued feeling\r\nat my heart which the presence of death inspires.\r\n\r\nIt was a large square room, looking all the larger from the absence\r\nof all furniture. A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it was\r\nblotched in places with mildew, and here and there great strips had\r\nbecome detached and hung down, exposing the yellow plaster beneath.\r\nOpposite the door was a showy fireplace, surmounted by a mantelpiece of\r\nimitation white marble. On one corner of this was stuck the stump of a\r\nred wax candle. The solitary window was so dirty that the light was\r\nhazy and uncertain, giving a dull grey tinge to everything, which was\r\nintensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole apartment.\r\n\r\nAll these details I observed afterwards. At present my attention was\r\ncentred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon\r\nthe boards, with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured\r\nceiling. It was that of a man about forty-three or forty-four years of\r\nage, middle-sized, broad shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and\r\na short stubbly beard. He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat\r\nand waistcoat, with light-coloured trousers, and immaculate collar\r\nand cuffs. A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floor\r\nbeside him. His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while\r\nhis lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been a\r\ngrievous one. On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror,\r\nand as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human\r\nfeatures. This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low\r\nforehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a singularly\r\nsimious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his writhing,\r\nunnatural posture. I have seen death in many forms, but never has\r\nit appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy\r\napartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nLestrade, lean and ferret-like as ever, was standing by the doorway, and\r\ngreeted my companion and myself.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis case will make a stir, sir,\u201d he remarked. \u201cIt beats anything I\r\nhave seen, and I am no chicken.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is no clue?\u201d said Gregson.\r\n\r\n\u201cNone at all,\u201d chimed in Lestrade.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes approached the body, and, kneeling down, examined it\r\nintently. \u201cYou are sure that there is no wound?\u201d he asked, pointing to\r\nnumerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round.\r\n\r\n\u201cPositive!\u201d cried both detectives.\r\n\r\n\u201cThen, of course, this blood belongs to a second individual--[8]\r\npresumably the murderer, if murder has been committed. It reminds me of\r\nthe circumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen, in Utrecht, in\r\nthe year \u201834. Do you remember the case, Gregson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRead it up--you really should. There is nothing new under the sun.

So swiftly was\r\nthe examination made, that one would hardly have guessed the minuteness\r\nwith which it was conducted.

At his call they entered\r\nthe room, and the stranger was lifted and carried out. As they raised\r\nhim, a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor. Lestrade grabbed\r\nit up and stared at it with mystified eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a woman here,\u201d he cried. \u201cIt\u2019s a woman\u2019s wedding-ring.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe held it out, as he spoke, upon the palm of his hand. We all gathered\r\nround him and gazed at it. There could be no doubt that that circlet of\r\nplain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis complicates matters,\u201d said Gregson. \u201cHeaven knows, they were\r\ncomplicated enough before.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure it doesn\u2019t simplify them?\u201d observed Holmes. \u201cThere\u2019s\r\nnothing to be learned by staring at it. What did you find in his\r\npockets?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have it all here,\u201d said Gregson, pointing to a litter of objects\r\nupon one of the bottom steps of the stairs. \u201cA gold watch, No. 97163, by\r\nBarraud, of London. Gold Albert chain, very heavy and solid. Gold ring,\r\nwith masonic device. Gold pin--bull-dog\u2019s head, with rubies as eyes.\r\nRussian leather card-case, with cards of Enoch J.

They are both\r\nfrom the Guion Steamship Company, and refer to the sailing of their\r\nboats from Liverpool. It is clear that this unfortunate man was about to\r\nreturn to New York.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you made any inquiries as to this man, Stangerson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI did it at once, sir,\u201d said Gregson. \u201cI have had advertisements\r\nsent to all the newspapers, and one of my men has gone to the American\r\nExchange, but he has not returned yet.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you sent to Cleveland?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe telegraphed this morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHow did you word your inquiries?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe simply detailed the circumstances, and said that we should be glad\r\nof any information which could help us.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to\r\nbe crucial?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI asked about Stangerson.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing else? Is there no circumstance on which this whole case appears\r\nto hinge? Will you not telegraph again?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have said all I have to say,\u201d said Gregson, in an offended voice.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes chuckled to himself, and appeared to be about to make\r\nsome remark, when Lestrade, who had been in the front room while we\r\nwere holding this conversation in the hall, reappeared upon the scene,\r\nrubbing his hands in a pompous and self-satisfied manner.\r\n\r\n\u201cMr. Gregson,\u201d he said, \u201cI have just made a discovery of the highest\r\nimportance, and one which would have been overlooked had I not made a\r\ncareful examination of the walls.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe little man\u2019s eyes sparkled as he spoke, and he was evidently in\r\na state of suppressed exultation at having scored a point against his\r\ncolleague.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome here,\u201d he said, bustling back into the room, the atmosphere of\r\nwhich felt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate. \u201cNow, stand\r\nthere!\u201d\r\n\r\nHe struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook at that!\u201d he said, triumphantly.\r\n\r\nI have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts. In this\r\nparticular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off, leaving a\r\nyellow square of coarse plastering.

The\r\nmurderer has written it with his or her own blood. See this smear where\r\nit has trickled down the wall! That disposes of the idea of suicide\r\nanyhow. Why was that corner chosen to write it on? I will tell you. See\r\nthat candle on the mantelpiece. It was lit at the time, and if it was\r\nlit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion of\r\nthe wall.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd what does it mean now that you _have_ found it?\u201d asked Gregson in a\r\ndepreciatory voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cMean? Why, it means that the writer was going to put the female name\r\nRachel, but was disturbed before he or she had time to finish. You mark\r\nmy words, when this case comes to be cleared up you will find that a\r\nwoman named Rachel has something to do with it. It\u2019s all very well for\r\nyou to laugh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. You may be very smart and clever, but\r\nthe old hound is the best, when all is said and done.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI really beg your pardon!\u201d said my companion, who had ruffled the\r\nlittle man\u2019s temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter. \u201cYou\r\ncertainly have the credit of being the first of us to find this out,\r\nand, as you say, it bears every mark of having been written by the other\r\nparticipant in last night\u2019s mystery. I have not had time to examine this\r\nroom yet, but with your permission I shall do so now.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying\r\nglass from his pocket. With these two implements he trotted noiselessly\r\nabout the room, sometimes stopping, occasionally kneeling, and once\r\nlying flat upon his face. So engrossed was he with his occupation that\r\nhe appeared to have forgotten our presence, for he chattered away to\r\nhimself under his breath the whole time, keeping up a running fire\r\nof exclamations, groans, whistles, and little cries suggestive of\r\nencouragement and of hope. As I watched him I was irresistibly reminded\r\nof a pure-blooded well-trained foxhound as it dashes backwards and\r\nforwards through the covert, whining in its eagerness, until it comes\r\nacross the lost scent. For twenty minutes or more he continued his\r\nresearches, measuring with the most exact care the distance between\r\nmarks which were entirely invisible to me, and occasionally applying his\r\ntape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible manner. In one place\r\nhe gathered up very carefully a little pile of grey dust from the floor,\r\nand packed it away in an envelope. Finally, he examined with his glass\r\nthe word upon the wall, going over every letter of it with the most\r\nminute exactness. This done, he appeared to be satisfied, for he\r\nreplaced his tape and his glass in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains,\u201d he\r\nremarked with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s a very bad definition, but it does apply to\r\ndetective work.\u201d\r\n\r\nGregson and Lestrade had watched the manoeuvres [9] of their amateur\r\ncompanion with considerable curiosity and some contempt. They evidently\r\nfailed to appreciate the fact, which I had begun to realize, that\r\nSherlock Holmes\u2019 smallest actions were all directed towards some\r\ndefinite and practical end.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do you think of it, sir?\u201d they both asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to presume\r\nto help you,\u201d remarked my friend. \u201cYou are doing so well now that it\r\nwould be a pity for anyone to interfere.\u201d There was a world of\r\nsarcasm in his voice as he spoke. \u201cIf you will let me know how your\r\ninvestigations go,\u201d he continued, \u201cI shall be happy to give you any help\r\nI can.

He was more than six feet high, was in the prime of life, had\r\nsmall feet for his height, wore coarse, square-toed boots and smoked a\r\nTrichinopoly cigar. He came here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab,\r\nwhich was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his\r\noff fore leg. In all probability the murderer had a florid face, and the\r\nfinger-nails of his right hand were remarkably long.

Sherlock\r\nHolmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a\r\nlong telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take us\r\nto the address given us by Lestrade.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere is nothing like first hand evidence,\u201d he remarked; \u201cas a matter\r\nof fact, my mind is entirely made up upon the case, but still we may as\r\nwell learn all that is to be learned.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou amaze me, Holmes,\u201d said I. \u201cSurely you are not as sure as you\r\npretend to be of all those particulars which you gave.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no room for a mistake,\u201d he answered. \u201cThe very first thing\r\nwhich I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts with\r\nits wheels close to the curb. Now, up to last night, we have had no rain\r\nfor a week, so that those wheels which left such a deep impression must\r\nhave been there during the night. There were the marks of the horse\u2019s\r\nhoofs, too, the outline of one of which was far more clearly cut than\r\nthat of the other three, showing that that was a new shoe. Since the cab\r\nwas there after the rain began, and was not there at any time during the\r\nmorning--I have Gregson\u2019s word for that--it follows that it must have\r\nbeen there during the night, and, therefore, that it brought those two\r\nindividuals to the house.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat seems simple enough,\u201d said I; \u201cbut how about the other man\u2019s\r\nheight?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, the height of a man, in nine cases out of ten, can be told from\r\nthe length of his stride. It is a simple calculation enough, though\r\nthere is no use my boring you with figures. I had this fellow\u2019s stride\r\nboth on the clay outside and on the dust within. Then I had a way of\r\nchecking my calculation. When a man writes on a wall, his instinct leads\r\nhim to write about the level of his own eyes. Now that writing was just\r\nover six feet from the ground. It was child\u2019s play.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd his age?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, if a man can stride four and a-half feet without the smallest\r\neffort, he can\u2019t be quite in the sere and yellow. That was the breadth\r\nof a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across.\r\nPatent-leather boots had gone round, and Square-toes had hopped over.\r\nThere is no mystery about it at all. I am simply applying to ordinary\r\nlife a few of those precepts of observation and deduction which I\r\nadvocated in that article. Is there anything else that puzzles you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe finger nails and the Trichinopoly,\u201d I suggested.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe writing on the wall was done with a man\u2019s forefinger dipped in\r\nblood. My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly\r\nscratched in doing it, which would not have been the case if the man\u2019s\r\nnail had been trimmed. I gathered up some scattered ash from the floor.\r\nIt was dark in colour and flakey--such an ash as is only made by a\r\nTrichinopoly.

You must not ask me that at the present state of the affair.\u201d\r\n\r\nI passed my hand over my brow. \u201cMy head is in a whirl,\u201d I remarked; \u201cthe\r\nmore one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows. How came these two\r\nmen--if there were two men--into an empty house? What has become of the\r\ncabman who drove them? How could one man compel another to take poison?\r\nWhere did the blood come from? What was the object of the murderer,\r\nsince robbery had no part in it? How came the woman\u2019s ring there? Above\r\nall, why should the second man write up the German word RACHE before\r\ndecamping? I confess that I cannot see any possible way of reconciling\r\nall these facts.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy companion smiled approvingly.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well,\u201d he\r\nsaid. \u201cThere is much that is still obscure, though I have quite made up\r\nmy mind on the main facts. As to poor Lestrade\u2019s discovery it was simply\r\na blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track, by suggesting\r\nSocialism and secret societies. It was not done by a German. The A, if\r\nyou noticed, was printed somewhat after the German fashion. Now, a real\r\nGerman invariably prints in the Latin character, so that we may safely\r\nsay that this was not written by one, but by a clumsy imitator who\r\noverdid his part. It was simply a ruse to divert inquiry into a wrong\r\nchannel. I\u2019m not going to tell you much more of the case, Doctor. You\r\nknow a conjuror gets no credit when once he has explained his trick,\r\nand if I show you too much of my method of working, you will come to the\r\nconclusion that I am a very ordinary individual after all.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI shall never do that,\u201d I answered; \u201cyou have brought detection as near\r\nan exact science as it ever will be brought in this world.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy companion flushed up with pleasure at my words, and the earnest way\r\nin which I uttered them. I had already observed that he was as sensitive\r\nto flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of her beauty.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you one other thing,\u201d he said. \u201cPatent leathers [10] and\r\nSquare-toes came in the same cab, and they walked down the pathway\r\ntogether as friendly as possible--arm-in-arm, in all probability.\r\nWhen they got inside they walked up and down the room--or rather,\r\nPatent-leathers stood still while Square-toes walked up and down. I\r\ncould read all that in the dust; and I could read that as he walked he\r\ngrew more and more excited. That is shown by the increased length of his\r\nstrides. He was talking all the while, and working himself up, no doubt,\r\ninto a fury. Then the tragedy occurred. I\u2019ve told you all I know myself\r\nnow, for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture. We have a good working\r\nbasis, however, on which to start. We must hurry up, for I want to go to\r\nHalle\u2019s concert to hear Norman Neruda this afternoon.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way\r\nthrough a long succession of dingy streets and dreary by-ways. In the\r\ndingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand.\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s Audley Court in there,\u201d he said, pointing to a narrow slit in\r\nthe line of dead-coloured brick. \u201cYou\u2019ll find me here when you come\r\nback.\u201d\r\n\r\nAudley Court was not an attractive locality. The narrow passage led us\r\ninto a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings.

At eleven there was a fight at the \u2018White\r\nHart\u2019; but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat. At one o\u2019clock it\r\nbegan to rain, and I met Harry Murcher--him who has the Holland Grove\r\nbeat--and we stood together at the corner of Henrietta Street a-talkin\u2019.\r\nPresently--maybe about two or a little after--I thought I would take\r\na look round and see that all was right down the Brixton Road. It was\r\nprecious dirty and lonely. Not a soul did I meet all the way down,\r\nthough a cab or two went past me. I was a strollin\u2019 down, thinkin\u2019\r\nbetween ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be, when\r\nsuddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of that same\r\nhouse. Now, I knew that them two houses in Lauriston Gardens was empty\r\non account of him that owns them who won\u2019t have the drains seen to,\r\nthough the very last tenant what lived in one of them died o\u2019 typhoid\r\nfever. I was knocked all in a heap therefore at seeing a light in\r\nthe window, and I suspected as something was wrong. When I got to the\r\ndoor----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou stopped, and then walked back to the garden gate,\u201d my companion\r\ninterrupted. \u201cWhat did you do that for?\u201d\r\n\r\nRance gave a violent jump, and stared at Sherlock Holmes with the utmost\r\namazement upon his features.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, that\u2019s true, sir,\u201d he said; \u201cthough how you come to know it,\r\nHeaven only knows. Ye see, when I got up to the door it was so still and\r\nso lonesome, that I thought I\u2019d be none the worse for some one with me.\r\nI ain\u2019t afeared of anything on this side o\u2019 the grave; but I thought\r\nthat maybe it was him that died o\u2019 the typhoid inspecting the drains\r\nwhat killed him. The thought gave me a kind o\u2019 turn, and I walked back\r\nto the gate to see if I could see Murcher\u2019s lantern, but there wasn\u2019t no\r\nsign of him nor of anyone else.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was no one in the street?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot a livin\u2019 soul, sir, nor as much as a dog. Then I pulled myself\r\ntogether and went back and pushed the door open. All was quiet inside,\r\nso I went into the room where the light was a-burnin\u2019. There was a\r\ncandle flickerin\u2019 on the mantelpiece--a red wax one--and by its light I\r\nsaw----\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I know all that you saw.

Go on, though. What did you do next?\u201d\r\n\r\nRance resumed his seat, without however losing his mystified expression.\r\n\u201cI went back to the gate and sounded my whistle.

After Holmes\u2019 departure for the concert, I\r\nlay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours\u2019 sleep.\r\nIt was a useless attempt. My mind had been too much excited by all that\r\nhad occurred, and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into\r\nit. Every time that I closed my eyes I saw before me the distorted\r\nbaboon-like countenance of the murdered man. So sinister was the\r\nimpression which that face had produced upon me that I found it\r\ndifficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who had removed its\r\nowner from the world. If ever human features bespoke vice of the most\r\nmalignant type, they were certainly those of Enoch J. Drebber, of\r\nCleveland. Still I recognized that justice must be done, and that the\r\ndepravity of the victim was no condonment [11] in the eyes of the law.\r\n\r\nThe more I thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion\u2019s\r\nhypothesis, that the man had been poisoned, appear. I remembered how he\r\nhad sniffed his lips, and had no doubt that he had detected something\r\nwhich had given rise to the idea. Then, again, if not poison, what\r\nhad caused the man\u2019s death, since there was neither wound nor marks of\r\nstrangulation? But, on the other hand, whose blood was that which lay so\r\nthickly upon the floor? There were no signs of a st'), NULL);

As\r\nlong as all these questions were unsolved, I felt that sleep would be\r\nno easy matter, either for Holmes or myself.

You\u2019re not looking quite\r\nyourself. This Brixton Road affair has upset you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTo tell the truth, it has,\u201d I said. \u201cI ought to be more case-hardened\r\nafter my Afghan experiences. I saw my own comrades hacked to pieces at\r\nMaiwand without losing my nerve.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI can understand. There is a mystery about this which stimulates the\r\nimagination; where there is no imagination there is no horror. Have you\r\nseen the evening paper?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt gives a fairly good account of the affair. It does not mention the\r\nfact that when the man was raised up, a woman\u2019s wedding ring fell upon\r\nthe floor. It is just as well it does not.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cLook at this advertisement,\u201d he answered. \u201cI had one sent to every\r\npaper this morning immediately after the affair.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe threw the paper across to me and I glanced at the place indicated. It\r\nwas the first announcement in the \u201cFound\u201d column. \u201cIn Brixton Road,\r\nthis morning,\u201d it ran, \u201ca plain gold wedding ring, found in the roadway\r\nbetween the \u2018White Hart\u2019 Tavern and Holland Grove.

It\r\nis almost a facsimile.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd who do you expect will answer this advertisement.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, the man in the brown coat--our florid friend with the square toes.\r\nIf he does not come himself he will send an accomplice.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWould he not consider it as too dangerous?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNot at all. If my view of the case is correct, and I have every reason\r\nto believe that it is, this man would rather risk anything than lose the\r\nring. According to my notion he dropped it while stooping over Drebber\u2019s\r\nbody, and did not miss it at the time. After leaving the house he\r\ndiscovered his loss and hurried back, but found the police already in\r\npossession, owing to his own folly in leaving the candle burning. He had\r\nto pretend to be drunk in order to allay the suspicions which might have\r\nbeen aroused by his appearance at the gate. Now put yourself in that\r\nman\u2019s place. On thinking the matter over, it must have occurred to him\r\nthat it was possible that he had lost the ring in the road after leaving\r\nthe house. What would he do, then? He would eagerly look out for the\r\nevening papers in the hope of seeing it among the articles found. His\r\neye, of course, would light upon this. He would be overjoyed. Why should\r\nhe fear a trap? There would be no reason in his eyes why the finding\r\nof the ring should be connected with the murder. He would come. He will\r\ncome. You shall see him within an hour?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd then?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, you can leave me to deal with him then.

We\r\ncould not hear the servant\u2019s reply, but the door closed, and some one\r\nbegan to ascend the stairs. The footfall was an uncertain and shuffling\r\none. A look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as he\r\nlistened to it. It came slowly along the passage, and there was a feeble\r\ntap at the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome in,\u201d I cried.\r\n\r\nAt my summons, instead of the man of violence whom we expected, a very\r\nold and wrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment. She appeared to be\r\ndazzled by the sudden blaze of light, and after dropping a curtsey, she\r\nstood blinking at us with her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocket\r\nwith nervous, shaky fingers. I glanced at my companion, and his face\r\nhad assumed such a disconsolate expression that it was all I could do to\r\nkeep my countenance.\r\n\r\nThe old crone drew out an evening paper, and pointed at our\r\nadvertisement. \u201cIt\u2019s this as has brought me, good gentlemen,\u201d she said,\r\ndropping another curtsey; \u201ca gold wedding ring in the Brixton Road.

Each had a long account of the affair, and some had leaders upon it\r\nin addition. There was some information in them which was new to me. I\r\nstill retain in my scrap-book numerous clippings and extracts bearing\r\nupon the case. Here is a condensation of a few of them:--\r\n\r\nThe _Daily Telegraph_ remarked that in the history of crime there had\r\nseldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features. The German\r\nname of the victim, the absence of all other motive, and the sinister\r\ninscription on the wall, all pointed to its perpetration by political\r\nrefugees and revolutionists. The Socialists had many branches in\r\nAmerica, and the deceased had, no doubt, infringed their unwritten laws,\r\nand been tracked down by them. After alluding airily to the Vehmgericht,\r\naqua tofana, Carbonari, the Marchioness de Brinvilliers, the Darwinian\r\ntheory, the principles of Malthus, and the Ratcliff Highway murders, the\r\narticle concluded by admonishing the Government and advocating a closer\r\nwatch over foreigners in England.\r\n\r\nThe _Standard_ commented upon the fact that lawless outrages of the sort\r\nusually occurred under a Liberal Administration. They arose from the\r\nunsettling of the minds of the masses, and the consequent weakening\r\nof all authority. The deceased was an American gentleman who had\r\nbeen residing for some weeks in the Metropolis. He had stayed at the\r\nboarding-house of Madame Charpentier, in Torquay Terrace, Camberwell.\r\nHe was accompanied in his travels by his private secretary, Mr. Joseph\r\nStangerson. The two bade adieu to their landlady upon Tuesday, the\r\n4th inst., and departed to Euston Station with the avowed intention of\r\ncatching the Liverpool express. They were afterwards seen together upon\r\nthe platform. Nothing more is known of them until Mr. Drebber\u2019s body\r\nwas, as recorded, discovered in an empty house in the Brixton Road,\r\nmany miles from Euston. How he came there, or how he met his fate, are\r\nquestions which are still involved in mystery. Nothing is known of the\r\nwhereabouts of Stangerson. We are glad to learn that Mr. Lestrade and\r\nMr. Gregson, of Scotland Yard, are both engaged upon the case, and it\r\nis confidently anticipated that these well-known officers will speedily\r\nthrow light upon the matter.\r\n\r\nThe _Daily News_ observed that there was no doubt as to the crime being\r\na political one. The despotism and hatred of Liberalism which animated\r\nthe Continental Governments had had the effect of driving to our shores\r\na number of men who might have made excellent citizens were they not\r\nsoured by the recollection of all that they had undergone. Among these\r\nmen there was a stringent code of honour, any infringement of which was\r\npunished by death. Every effort should be made to find the secretary,\r\nStangerson, and to ascertain some particulars of the habits of the\r\ndeceased. A great step had been gained by the discovery of the address\r\nof the house at which he had boarded--a result which was entirely due to\r\nthe acuteness and energy of Mr. Gregson of Scotland Yard.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes and I read these notices over together at breakfast, and\r\nthey appeared to afford him considerable amusement.\r\n\r\n\u201cI told you that, whatever happened, Lestrade and Gregson would be sure\r\nto score.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat depends on how it turns out.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh, bless you, it doesn\u2019t matter in the least.

Will you have some whiskey and water?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind if I do,\u201d the detective answered. \u201cThe tremendous\r\nexertions which I have gone through during the last day or two have worn\r\nme out.

He is\r\nafter the secretary Stangerson, who had no more to do with the crime\r\nthan the babe unborn.

Do not imagine that my agitation on behalf\r\nof my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand in this\r\nterrible affair. He is utterly innocent of it. My dread is, however,\r\nthat in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to be\r\ncompromised. That however is surely impossible. His high character, his\r\nprofession, his antecedents would all forbid it.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts,\u2019 I answered.\r\n\u2018Depend upon it, if your son is innocent he will be none the worse.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Perhaps, Alice, you had better leave us together,\u2019 she said, and her\r\ndaughter withdrew. \u2018Now, sir,\u2019 she continued, \u2018I had no intention of\r\ntelling you all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it I\r\nhave no alternative.

Stangerson was a quiet reserved man, but his\r\nemployer, I am sorry to say, was far otherwise. He was coarse in his\r\nhabits and brutish in his ways. The very night of his arrival he became\r\nvery much the worse for drink, and, indeed, after twelve o\u2019clock in the\r\nday he could hardly ever be said to be sober.

When I closed the\r\ndoor behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind. Alas, in\r\nless than an hour there was a ring at the bell, and I learned that Mr.\r\nDrebber had returned. He was much excited, and evidently the worse for\r\ndrink. He forced his way into the room, where I was sitting with my\r\ndaughter, and made some incoherent remark about having missed his train.\r\nHe then turned to Alice, and before my very face, proposed to her that\r\nshe should fly with him. \u201cYou are of age,\u201d he said, \u201cand there is no law\r\nto stop you. I have money enough and to spare. Never mind the old girl\r\nhere, but come along with me now straight away. You shall live like a\r\nprincess.\u201d Poor Alice was so frightened that she shrunk away from him,\r\nbut he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured to draw her towards the\r\ndoor. I screamed, and at that moment my son Arthur came into the room.\r\nWhat happened then I do not know. I heard oaths and the confused sounds\r\nof a scuffle. I was too terrified to raise my head.

This fresh development has shown me that I was\r\ncompletely mistaken. Full of the one idea, I set myself to find out\r\nwhat had become of the Secretary. They had been seen together at Euston\r\nStation about half-past eight on the evening of the third. At two in the\r\nmorning Drebber had been found in the Brixton Road. The question which\r\nconfronted me was to find out how Stangerson had been employed between\r\n8.30 and the time of the crime, and what had become of him afterwards.\r\nI telegraphed to Liverpool, giving a description of the man, and warning\r\nthem to keep a watch upon the American boats. I then set to work calling\r\nupon all the hotels and lodging-houses in the vicinity of Euston. You\r\nsee, I argued that if Drebber and his companion had become separated,\r\nthe natural course for the latter would be to put up somewhere in the\r\nvicinity for the night, and then to hang about the sta'), NULL);

I spent the whole of yesterday evening in making\r\nenquiries entirely without avail. This morning I began very early, and\r\nat eight o\u2019clock I reached Halliday\u2019s Private Hotel, in Little George\r\nStreet. On my enquiry as to whether a Mr. Stangerson was living there,\r\nthey at once answered me in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018No doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting,\u2019 they said. \u2018He\r\nhas been waiting for a gentleman for two days.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018Where is he now?\u2019 I asked.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018He is upstairs in bed. He wished to be called at nine.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018I will go up and see him at once,\u2019 I said.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves and\r\nlead him to say something unguarded. The Boots volunteered to show me\r\nthe room: it was on the second floor, and there was a small corridor\r\nleading up to it. The Boots pointed out the door to me, and was about to\r\ngo downstairs again when I saw something that made me feel sickish, in\r\nspite of my twenty years\u2019 experience. From under the door there curled\r\na little red ribbon of blood, which had meandered across the passage and\r\nformed a little pool along the skirting at the other side. I gave a cry,\r\nwhich brought the Boots back. He nearly fainted when he saw it. The door\r\nwas locked on the inside, but we put our shoulders to it, and knocked it\r\nin. The window of the room was open, and beside the window, all huddled\r\nup, lay the body of a man in his nightdress. He was quite dead, and had\r\nbeen for some time, for his limbs were rigid and cold. When we turned\r\nhim over, the Boots recognized him at once as being the same gentleman\r\nwho had engaged the room under the name of Joseph Stangerson. The cause\r\nof death was a deep stab in the left side, which must have penetrated\r\nthe heart. And now comes the strangest part of the affair. What do you\r\nsuppose was above the murdered man?\u201d\r\n\r\nI felt a creeping of the flesh, and a presentiment of coming horror,\r\neven before Sherlock Holmes answered.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe word RACHE, written in letters of blood,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was it,\u201d said Lestrade, in an awe-struck voice; and we were all\r\nsilent for a while.\r\n\r\nThere was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the\r\ndeeds of this unknown assassin, that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to\r\nhis crimes. My nerves, which were steady enough on the field of battle\r\ntingled as I thought of it.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe man was seen,\u201d continued Lestrade. \u201cA milk boy, passing on his way\r\nto the dairy, happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews\r\nat the back of the hotel. He noticed that a ladder, which usually lay\r\nthere, was raised against one of the windows of the second floor, which\r\nwas wide open. After passing, he looked back and saw a man descend the\r\nladder. He came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to\r\nbe some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel. He took no particular\r\nnotice of him, beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for him\r\nto be at work. He has an impression that the man was tall, had a reddish\r\nface, and was dressed in a long, brownish coat. He must have stayed in\r\nthe room some little time after the murder, for we found blood-stained\r\nwater in the basin, where he had washed his hands, and marks on the\r\nsheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife.\u201d\r\n\r\nI glanced at Holmes on hearing the description of the murderer, which\r\ntallied so exactly with his own. There was, however, no trace of\r\nexultation or satisfaction upon his face.\r\n\r\n\u201cDid you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the\r\nmurderer?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cNothing. Stangerson had Drebber\u2019s purse in his pocket, but it seems\r\nthat this was usual, as he did all the paying. There was eighty odd\r\npounds in it, but nothing had been taken. Whatever the motives of these\r\nextraordinary crimes, robbery is certainly not one of them.

I will give you a proof of my knowledge. Could you lay your hand\r\nupon those pills?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have them,\u201d said Lestrade, producing a small white box; \u201cI took them\r\nand the purse and the telegram, intending to have them put in a place of\r\nsafety at the Police Station. It was the merest chance my taking these\r\npills, for I am bound to say that I do not attach any importance to\r\nthem.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGive them here,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cNow, Doctor,\u201d turning to me, \u201care those\r\nordinary pills?\u201d\r\n\r\nThey certainly were not. They were of a pearly grey colour, small,\r\nround, and almost transparent against the light. \u201cFrom their lightness\r\nand transparency, I should imagine that they are soluble in water,\u201d I\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\n\u201cPrecisely so,\u201d answered Holmes. \u201cNow would you mind going down and\r\nfetching that poor little devil of a terrier which has been bad so long,\r\nand which the landlady wanted you to put out of its pain yesterday.\u201d\r\n\r\nI went downstairs and carried the dog upstair in my arms. It\u2019s laboured\r\nbreathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end.\r\nIndeed, its snow-white muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceeded\r\nthe usual term of canine existence. I placed it upon a cushion on the\r\nrug.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will now cut one of these pills in two,\u201d said Holmes, and drawing his\r\npenknife he suited the action to the word. \u201cOne half we return into the\r\nbox for future purposes. The other half I will place in this wine glass,\r\nin which is a teaspoonful of water. You perceive that our friend, the\r\nDoctor, is right, and that it readily dissolves.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis may be very interesting,\u201d said Lestrade, in the injured tone of\r\none who suspects that he is being laughed at, \u201cI cannot see, however,\r\nwhat it has to do with the death of Mr. Joseph Stangerson.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPatience, my friend, patience! You will find in time that it has\r\neverything to do with it. I shall now add a little milk to make the\r\nmixture palatable, and on presenting it to the dog we find that he laps\r\nit up readily enough.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer and\r\nplaced it in front of the terrier, who speedily licked it dry. Sherlock\r\nHolmes\u2019 earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in\r\nsilence, watching the animal intently, and expecting some startling\r\neffect. None such appeared, however. The dog continued to lie stretched\r\nupon tho [16] cushion, breathing in a laboured way, but apparently\r\nneither the better nor the worse for its draught.\r\n\r\nHolmes had taken out his watch, and as minute followed minute without\r\nresult, an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared\r\nupon his features. He gnawed his lip, drummed his fingers upon the\r\ntable, and showed every other symptom of acute impatience.

I have it!\u201d With a perfect shriek of delight he\r\nrushed to the box, cut the other pill in two, dissolved it, added milk,\r\nand presented it to the terrier.

Of the two pills in that box one was of the most deadly\r\npoison, and the other was entirely harmless. I ought to have known that\r\nbefore ever I saw the box at all.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis last statement appeared to me to be so startling, that I could\r\nhardly believe that he was in his sober senses. There was the dead dog,\r\nhowever, to prove that his conjecture had been correct. It seemed to me\r\nthat the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away, and I began\r\nto have a dim, vague perception of the truth.\r\n\r\n\u201cAll this seems strange to you,\u201d continued Holmes, \u201cbecause you failed\r\nat the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single\r\nreal clue which was presented to you. I had the good fortune to seize\r\nupon that, and everything which has occurred since then has served to\r\nconfirm my original supposition, and, indeed, was the logical sequence\r\nof it. Hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more\r\nobscure, have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions.\r\nIt is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery. The most\r\ncommonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no\r\nnew or special features from which deductions may be drawn. This murder\r\nwould have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of\r\nthe victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of\r\nthose _outr\u00e9_ and sensational accompaniments which have rendered\r\nit remarkable. These strange details, far from making the case more\r\ndifficult, have really had the effect of making it less so.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Gregson, who had listened to this address with considerable\r\nimpatience, could contain himself no longer. \u201cLook here, Mr. Sherlock\r\nHolmes,\u201d he said, \u201cwe are all ready to acknowledge that you are a smart\r\nman, and that you have your own methods of working. We want something\r\nmore than mere theory and preaching now, though. It is a case of taking\r\nthe man. I have made my case out, and it seems I was wrong. Young\r\nCharpentier could not have been engaged in this second affair. Lestrade\r\nwent after his man, Stangerson, and it appears that he was wrong too.\r\nYou have thrown out hints here, and hints there, and seem to know more\r\nthan we do, but the time has come when we feel that we have a right to\r\nask you straight how much you do know of the business.

ON THE GREAT ALKALI PLAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the central portion of the great North American Continent there lies\r\nan arid and repulsive desert, which for many a long year served as a\r\nbarrier against the advance of civilisation. From the Sierra Nevada to\r\nNebraska, and from the Yellowstone River in the north to the Colorado\r\nupon the south, is a region of desolation and silence. Nor is Nature\r\nalways in one mood throughout this grim district. It comprises\r\nsnow-capped and lofty mountains, and dark and gloomy valleys. There are\r\nswift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged ca\u00f1ons; and there are\r\nenormous plains, which in winter are white with snow, and in summer are\r\ngrey with the saline alkali dust. They all preserve, however, the common\r\ncharacteristics of barrenness, inhospitality, and misery.\r\n\r\nThere are no inhabitants of this land of despair. A band of Pawnees\r\nor of Blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other\r\nhunting-grounds, but the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose sight\r\nof those awesome plains, and to find themselves once more upon their\r\nprairies. The coyote skulks among the scrub, the buzzard flaps heavily\r\nthrough the air, and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through the dark\r\nravines, and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the rocks. These\r\nare the sole dwellers in the wilderness.\r\n\r\nIn the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from\r\nthe northern slope of the Sierra Blanco. As far as the eye can reach\r\nstretches the great flat plain-land, all dusted over with patches of\r\nalkali, and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes. On\r\nthe extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks,\r\nwith their rugged summits flecked with snow. In this great stretch of\r\ncountry there is no sign of life, nor of anything appertaining to life.\r\nThere is no bird in the steel-blue heaven, no movement upon the dull,\r\ngrey earth--above all, there is absolute silence. Listen as one may,\r\nthere is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness; nothing but\r\nsilence--complete and heart-subduing silence.\r\n\r\nIt has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad\r\nplain. That is hardly true. Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, one\r\nsees a pathway traced out across the desert, which winds away and is\r\nlost in the extreme distance. It is rutted with wheels and trodden down\r\nby the feet of many adventurers. Here and there there are scattered\r\nwhite objects which glisten in the sun, and stand out against the dull\r\ndeposit of alkali. Approach, and examine them! They are bones: some\r\nlarge and coarse, others smaller and more delicate. The former have\r\nbelonged to oxen, and the latter to men. For fifteen hundred miles one\r\nmay trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those\r\nwho had fallen by the wayside.\r\n\r\nLooking down on this very scene, there stood upon the fourth of May,\r\neighteen hundred and forty-seven, a solitary traveller. His appearance\r\nwas such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the region.\r\nAn observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was nearer\r\nto forty or to sixty. His face was lean and haggard, and the brown\r\nparchment-like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones; his\r\nlong, brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white; his\r\neyes were sunken in his head, and burned with an unnatural lustre; while\r\nthe hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of a\r\nskeleton.

His gaunt face, however, and his clothes,\r\nwhich hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs, proclaimed what it\r\nwas that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance. The man was\r\ndying--dying from hunger and from thirst.\r\n\r\nHe had toiled painfully down the ravine, and on to this little\r\nelevation, in the vain hope of seeing some signs of water. Now the great\r\nsalt plain stretched before his eyes, and the distant belt of savage\r\nmountains, without a sign anywhere of plant or tree, which might\r\nindicate the presence of moisture. In all that broad landscape there\r\nwas no gleam of hope. North, and east, and west he looked with wild\r\nquestioning eyes, and then he realised that his wanderings had come to\r\nan end, and that there, on that barren crag, he was about to die. \u201cWhy\r\nnot here, as well as in a feather bed, twenty years hence,\u201d he muttered,\r\nas he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder.\r\n\r\nBefore sitting down, he had deposited upon the ground his useless rifle,\r\nand also a large bundle tied up in a grey shawl, which he had carried\r\nslung over his right shoulder. It appeared to be somewhat too heavy for\r\nhis strength, for in lowering it, it came down on the ground with some\r\nlittle violence. Instantly there broke from the grey parcel a little\r\nmoaning cry, and from it there protruded a small, scared face, with very\r\nbright brown eyes, and two little speckled, dimpled fists.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve hurt me!\u201d said a childish voice reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\u201cHave I though,\u201d the man answered penitently, \u201cI didn\u2019t go for to do\r\nit.\u201d As he spoke he unwrapped the grey shawl and extricated a pretty\r\nlittle girl of about five years of age, whose dainty shoes and smart\r\npink frock with its little linen apron all bespoke a mother\u2019s care. The\r\nchild was pale and wan, but her healthy arms and legs showed that she\r\nhad suffered less than her companion.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow is it now?\u201d he answered anxiously, for she was still rubbing the\r\ntowsy golden curls which covered the back of her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cKiss it and make it well,\u201d she said, with perfect gravity, shoving\r\n[19] the injured part up to him. \u201cThat\u2019s what mother used to do. Where\u2019s\r\nmother?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMother\u2019s gone. I guess you\u2019ll see her before long.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGone, eh!\u201d said the little girl. \u201cFunny, she didn\u2019t say good-bye; she\r\n\u2018most always did if she was just goin\u2019 over to Auntie\u2019s for tea, and now\r\nshe\u2019s been away three days. Say, it\u2019s awful dry, ain\u2019t it? Ain\u2019t there\r\nno water, nor nothing to eat?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, there ain\u2019t nothing, dearie. You\u2019ll just need to be patient awhile,\r\nand then you\u2019ll be all right. Put your head up agin me like that, and\r\nthen you\u2019ll feel bullier.

Side by side on the narrow shawl knelt the two wanderers, the little\r\nprattling child and the reckless, hardened adventurer. Her chubby face,\r\nand his haggard, angular visage were both turned up to the cloudless\r\nheaven in heartfelt entreaty to that dread being with whom they were\r\nface to face, while the two voices--the one thin and clear, the other\r\ndeep and harsh--united in the entreaty for mercy and forgiveness. The\r\nprayer finished, they resumed their seat in the shadow of the boulder\r\nuntil the child fell asleep, nestling upon the broad breast of her\r\nprotector. He watched over her slumber for some time, but Nature proved\r\nto be too strong for him. For three days and three nights he had allowed\r\nhimself neither rest nor repose. Slowly the eyelids drooped over the\r\ntired eyes, and the head sunk lower and lower upon the breast, until the\r\nman\u2019s grizzled beard was mixed with the gold tresses of his companion,\r\nand both slept the same deep and dreamless slumber.\r\n\r\nHad the wanderer remained awake for another half hour a strange sight\r\nwould have met his eyes.

But what a caravan! When the head of it had reached the base\r\nof the mountains, the rear was not yet visible on the horizon. Right\r\nacross the enormous plain stretched the straggling array, waggons\r\nand carts, men on horseback, and men on foot. Innumerable women who\r\nstaggered along under burdens, and children who toddled beside the\r\nwaggons or peeped out from under the white coverings. This was evidently\r\nno ordinary party of immigrants, but rather some nomad people who had\r\nbeen compelled from stress of circumstances to seek themselves a new\r\ncountry. There rose through the clear air a confused clattering and\r\nrumbling from this great mass of humanity, with the creaking of wheels\r\nand the neighing of horses. Loud as it was, it was not sufficient to\r\nrouse the two tired wayfarers above them.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the column there rode a score or more of grave ironfaced\r\nmen, clad in sombre homespun garments and armed with rifles.

Amen!\u201d responded the whole party.\r\n\r\nThey were about to resume their journey when one of the youngest and\r\nkeenest-eyed uttered an exclamation and pointed up at the rugged crag\r\nabove them. From its summit there fluttered a little wisp of pink,\r\nshowing up hard and bright against the grey rocks behind. At the sight\r\nthere was a general reining up of horses and unslinging of guns, while\r\nfresh horsemen came galloping up to reinforce the vanguard. The word\r\n\u2018Redskins\u2019 was on every lip.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere can\u2019t be any number of Injuns here,\u201d said the elderly man who\r\nappeared to be in command. \u201cWe have passed the Pawnees, and there are no\r\nother tribes until we cross the great mountains.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShall I go forward and see, Brother Stangerson,\u201d asked one of the band.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd I,\u201d \u201cand I,\u201d cried a dozen voices.\r\n\r\n\u201cLeave your horses below and we will await you here,\u201d the Elder\r\nanswered. In a moment the young fellows had dismounted, fastened their\r\nhorses, and were ascending the precipitous slope which led up to the\r\nobject which had excited their curiosity.

Beside him\r\nlay a little child, with her round white arms encircling his brown\r\nsinewy neck, and her golden haired head resting upon the breast of his\r\nvelveteen tunic. Her rosy lips were parted, showing the regular line of\r\nsnow-white teeth within, and a playful smile played over her infantile\r\nfeatures. Her plump little white legs terminating in white socks and\r\nneat shoes with shining buckles, offered a strange contrast to the long\r\nshrivelled members of her companion.

Many were the cries\r\nof astonishment and of commiseration which arose from them when they\r\nperceived the youth of one of the strangers and the destitution of the\r\nother. Their escort did not halt, however, but pushed on, followed by\r\na great crowd of Mormons, until they reached a waggon, which was\r\nconspicuous for its great size and for the gaudiness and smartness of\r\nits appearance. Six horses were yoked to it, whereas the others were\r\nfurnished with two, or, at most, four a-piece. Beside the driver there\r\nsat a man who could not have been more than thirty years of age, but\r\nwhose massive head and resolute expression marked him as a leader.

From the\r\nshores of the Mississippi to the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains\r\nthey had struggled on with a constancy almost unparalleled in history.\r\nThe savage man, and the savage beast, hunger, thirst, fatigue, and\r\ndisease--every impediment which Nature could place in the way, had all\r\nbeen overcome with Anglo-Saxon tenacity. Yet the long journey and the\r\naccumulated terrors had shaken the hearts of the stoutest among them.\r\nThere was not one who did not sink upon his knees in heartfelt prayer\r\nwhen they saw the broad valley of Utah bathed in the sunlight beneath\r\nthem, and learned from the lips of their leader that this was the\r\npromised land, and that these virgin acres were to be theirs for\r\nevermore.\r\n\r\nYoung speedily proved himself to be a skilful administrator as well as a\r\nresolute chief. Maps were drawn and charts prepared, in which the future\r\ncity was sketched out. All around farms were apportioned and allotted in\r\nproportion to the standing of each individual. The tradesman was put\r\nto his trade and the artisan to his calling. In the town streets and\r\nsquares sprang up, as if by magic. In the country there was draining\r\nand hedging, planting and clearing, until the next summer saw the whole\r\ncountry golden with the wheat crop. Everything prospered in the strange\r\nsettlement. Above all, the great temple which they had erected in the\r\ncentre of the city grew ever taller and larger. From the first blush of\r\ndawn until the closing of the twilight, the clatter of the hammer\r\nand the rasp of the saw was never absent from the monument which the\r\nimmigrants erected to Him who had led them safe through many dangers.\r\n\r\nThe two castaways, John Ferrier and the little girl who had shared his\r\nfortunes and had been adopted as his daughter, accompanied the Mormons\r\nto the end of their great pilgrimage. Little Lucy Ferrier was borne\r\nalong pleasantly enough in Elder Stangerson\u2019s waggon, a retreat which\r\nshe shared with the Mormon\u2019s three wives and with his son, a headstrong\r\nforward boy of twelve. Having rallied, with the elasticity of childhood,\r\nfrom the shock caused by her mother\u2019s death, she soon became a pet\r\nwith the women, and reconciled herself to this new life in her moving\r\ncanvas-covered home. In the meantime Ferrier having recovered from his\r\nprivations, distinguished himself as a useful guide and an indefatigable\r\nhunter. So rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new companions, that\r\nwhen they reached the end of their wanderings, it was unanimously agreed\r\nthat he should be provided with as large and as fertile a tract of land\r\nas any of the settlers, with the exception of Young himself, and of\r\nStangerson, Kemball, Johnston, and Drebber, who were the four principal\r\nElders.\r\n\r\nOn the farm thus acquired John Ferrier built himself a substantial\r\nlog-house, which received so many additions in succeeding years that it\r\ngrew into a roomy villa. He was a man of a practical turn of mind,\r\nkeen in his dealings and skilful with his hands. His iron constitution\r\nenabled him to work morning and evening at improving and tilling his\r\nlands.

In three years he was better off than his\r\nneighbours, in six he was well-to-do, in nine he was rich, and in twelve\r\nthere were not half a dozen men in the whole of Salt Lake City who could\r\ncompare with him. From the great inland sea to the distant Wahsatch\r\nMountains there was no name better known than that of John Ferrier.\r\n\r\nThere was one way and only one in which he offended the susceptibilities\r\nof his co-religionists. No argument or persuasion could ever induce him\r\nto set up a female establishment after the manner of his companions. He\r\nnever gave reasons for this persistent refusal, but contented himself by\r\nresolutely and inflexibly adhering to his determination. There were some\r\nwho accused him of lukewarmness in his adopted religion, and others who\r\nput it down to greed of wealth and reluctance to incur expense. Others,\r\nagain, spoke of some early love affair, and of a fair-haired girl who\r\nhad pined away on the shores of the Atlantic. Whatever the reason,\r\nFerrier remained strictly celibate. In every other respect he conformed\r\nto the religion of the young settlement, and gained the name of being an\r\northodox and straight-walking man.\r\n\r\nLucy Ferrier grew up within the log-house, and assisted her adopted\r\nfather in all his undertakings. The keen air of the mountains and the\r\nbalsamic odour of the pine trees took the place of nurse and mother to\r\nthe young girl. As year succeeded to year she grew taller and stronger,\r\nher cheek more rudy, and her step more elastic. Many a wayfarer upon\r\nthe high road which ran by Ferrier\u2019s farm felt long-forgotten thoughts\r\nrevive in their mind as they watched her lithe girlish figure tripping\r\nthrough the wheatfields, or met her mounted upon her father\u2019s mustang,\r\nand managing it with all the ease and grace of a true child of the West.\r\nSo the bud blossomed into a flower, and the year which saw her father\r\nthe richest of the farmers left her as fair a specimen of American\r\ngirlhood as could be found in the whole Pacific slope.\r\n\r\nIt was not the father, however, who first discovered that the child had\r\ndeveloped into the woman. It seldom is in such cases. That mysterious\r\nchange is too subtle and too gradual to be measured by dates. Least of\r\nall does the maiden herself know it until the tone of a voice or the\r\ntouch of a hand sets her heart thrilling within her, and she learns,\r\nwith a mixture of pride and of fear, that a new and a larger nature has\r\nawoken within her. There are few who cannot recall that day and remember\r\nthe one little incident which heralded the dawn of a new life. In the\r\ncase of Lucy Ferrier the occasion was serious enough in itself, apart\r\nfrom its future influence on her destiny and that of many besides.\r\n\r\nIt was a warm June morning, and the Latter Day Saints were as busy as\r\nthe bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem. In the fields and\r\nin the streets rose the same hum of human industry. Down the dusty high\r\nroads defiled long streams of heavily-laden mules, all heading to the\r\nwest, for the gold fever had broken out in California, and the Overland\r\nRoute lay through the City of the Elect. There, too, were droves of\r\nsheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands, and trains\r\nof tired immigrants, men and horses equally weary of their interminable\r\njourney. Through all this motley assemblage, threading her way with the\r\nskill of an accomplished rider, there galloped Lucy Ferrier, her fair\r\nface flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut hair floating out\r\nbehind her. She had a commission from her father in the City, and was\r\ndashing in as she had done many a time before, with all the fearlessness\r\nof youth, thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed. The\r\ntravel-stained adventurers gazed after her in astonishment, and even\r\nthe unemotional Indians, journeying in with their pelties, relaxed their\r\naccustomed stoicism as they marvelled at the beauty of the pale-faced\r\nmaiden.\r\n\r\nShe had reached the outskirts of the city when she found the road\r\nblocked by a great drove of cattle, driven by a ha'), NULL);

In her impatience she endeavoured to pass this\r\nobstacle by pushing her horse into what appeared to be a gap. Scarcely\r\nhad she got fairly into it, however, before the beasts closed in behind\r\nher, and she found herself completely imbedded in the moving stream of\r\nfierce-eyed, long-horned bullocks. Accustomed as she was to deal with\r\ncattle, she was not alarmed at her situation, but took advantage of\r\nevery opportunity to urge her horse on in the hopes of pushing her way\r\nthrough the cavalcade. Unfortunately the horns of one of the creatures,\r\neither by accident or design, came in violent contact with the flank of\r\nthe mustang, and excited it to madness. In an instant it reared up upon\r\nits hind legs with a snort of rage, and pranced and tossed in a way that\r\nwould have unseated any but a most skilful rider. The situation was full\r\nof peril. Every plunge of the excited horse brought it against the horns\r\nagain, and goaded it to fresh madness. It was all that the girl could\r\ndo to keep herself in the saddle, yet a slip would mean a terrible death\r\nunder the hoofs of the unwieldy and terrified animals.

Choked by the rising cloud of dust and by the steam from the\r\nstruggling creatures, she might have abandoned her efforts in despair,\r\nbut for a kindly voice at her elbow which assured her of assistance. At\r\nthe same moment a sinewy brown hand caught the frightened horse by\r\nthe curb, and forcing a way through the drove, soon brought her to the\r\noutskirts.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not hurt, I hope, miss,\u201d said her preserver, respectfully.\r\n\r\nShe looked up at his dark, fierce face, and laughed saucily. \u201cI\u2019m awful\r\nfrightened,\u201d she said, naively; \u201cwhoever would have thought that Poncho\r\nwould have been so scared by a lot of cows?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThank God you kept your seat,\u201d the other said earnestly. He was a tall,\r\nsavage-looking young fellow, mounted on a powerful roan horse, and\r\nclad in the rough dress of a hunter, with a long rifle slung over his\r\nshoulders. \u201cI guess you are the daughter of John Ferrier,\u201d he remarked,\r\n\u201cI saw you ride down from his house. When you see him, ask him if he\r\nremembers the Jefferson Hopes of St. Louis.

The love which had sprung up in\r\nhis heart was not the sudden, changeable fancy of a boy, but rather the\r\nwild, fierce passion of a man of strong will and imperious temper. He\r\nhad been accustomed to succeed in all that he undertook. He swore in\r\nhis heart that he would not fail in this if human effort and human\r\nperseverance could render him successful.\r\n\r\nHe called on John Ferrier that night, and many times again, until\r\nhis face was a familiar one at the farm-house. John, cooped up in the\r\nvalley, and absorbed in his work, had had little chance of learning\r\nthe news of the outside world during the last twelve years. All this\r\nJefferson Hope was able to tell him, and in a style which interested\r\nLucy as well as her father. He had been a pioneer in California, and\r\ncould narrate many a strange tale of fortunes made and fortunes lost\r\nin those wild, halcyon days. He had been a scout too, and a trapper, a\r\nsilver explorer, and a ranchman. Wherever stirring adventures were to be\r\nhad, Jefferson Hope had been there in search of them. He soon became a\r\nfavourite with the old farmer, who spoke eloquently of his virtues. On\r\nsuch occasions, Lucy was silent, but her blushing cheek and her bright,\r\nhappy eyes, showed only too clearly that her young heart was no longer\r\nher own. Her honest father may not have observed these symptoms,\r\nbut they were assuredly not thrown away upon the man who had won her\r\naffections.\r\n\r\nIt was a summer evening when he came galloping down the road and pulled\r\nup at the gate. She was at the doorway, and came down to meet him. He\r\nthrew the bridle over the fence and strode up the pathway.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am off, Lucy,\u201d he said, taking her two hands in his, and gazing\r\ntenderly down into her face; \u201cI won\u2019t ask you to come with me now, but\r\nwill you be ready to come when I am here again?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd when will that be?\u201d she asked, blushing and laughing.\r\n\r\n\u201cA couple of months at the outside.

She stood at the gate, gazing after him until\r\nhe vanished from her sight.

John Ferrier\u2019s heart was sore within him\r\nwhen he thought of the young man\u2019s return, and of the impending loss of\r\nhis adopted child. Yet her bright and happy face reconciled him to\r\nthe arrangement more than any argument could have done. He had always\r\ndetermined, deep down in his resolute heart, that nothing would ever\r\ninduce him to allow his daughter to wed a Mormon. Such a marriage he\r\nregarded as no marriage at all, but as a shame and a disgrace. Whatever\r\nhe might think of the Mormon doctrines, upon that one point he was\r\ninflexible. He had to seal his mouth on the subject, however, for to\r\nexpress an unorthodox opinion was a dangerous matter in those days in\r\nthe Land of the Saints.\r\n\r\nYes, a dangerous matter--so dangerous that even the most saintly dared\r\nonly whisper their religious opinions with bated breath, lest someth'), NULL);

The victims of persecution had now turned\r\npersecutors on their own account, and persecutors of the most\r\nterrible description. Not the Inquisition of Seville, nor the German\r\nVehm-gericht, nor the Secret Societies of Italy, were ever able to put\r\na more formidable machinery in motion than that which cast a cloud over\r\nthe State of Utah.\r\n\r\nIts invisibility, and the mystery which was attached to it, made\r\nthis organization doubly terrible. It appeared to be omniscient and\r\nomnipotent, and yet was neither seen nor heard. The man who held out\r\nagainst the Church vanished away, and none knew whither he had gone or\r\nwhat had befallen him. His wife and his children awaited him at home,\r\nbut no father ever returned to tell them how he had fared at the\r\nhands of his secret judges. A rash word or a hasty act was followed\r\nby annihilation, and yet none knew what the nature might be of this\r\nterrible power which was suspended over them. No wonder that men\r\nwent about in fear and trembling, and that even in the heart of the\r\nwilderness they dared not whisper the doubts which oppressed them.\r\n\r\nAt first this vague and terrible power was exercised only upon the\r\nrecalcitrants who, having embraced the Mormon faith, wished afterwards\r\nto pervert or to abandon it. Soon, however, it took a wider range. The\r\nsupply of adult women was running short, and polygamy without a female\r\npopulation on which to draw was a barren doctrine indeed. Strange\r\nrumours began to be bandied about--rumours of murdered immigrants and\r\nrifled camps in regions where Indians had never been seen. Fresh women\r\nappeared in the harems of the Elders--women who pined and wept, and\r\nbore upon their faces the traces of an unextinguishable horror. Belated\r\nwanderers upon the mountains spoke of gangs of armed men, masked,\r\nstealthy, and noiseless, who flitted by them in the darkness. These\r\ntales and rumours took substance and shape, and were corroborated and\r\nre-corroborated, until they resolved themselves into a definite name.\r\nTo this day, in the lonely ranches of the West, the name of the Danite\r\nBand, or the Avenging Angels, is a sinister and an ill-omened one.\r\n\r\nFuller knowledge of the organization which produced such terrible\r\nresults served to increase rather than to lessen the horror which it\r\ninspired in the minds of men. None knew who belonged to this ruthless\r\nsociety. The names of the participators in the deeds of blood and\r\nviolence done under the name of religion were kept profoundly secret.\r\nThe very friend to whom you communicated your misgivings as to the\r\nProphet and his mission, might be one of those who would come forth at\r\nnight with fire and sword to exact a terrible reparation. Hence every\r\nman feared his neighbour, and none spoke of the things which were\r\nnearest his heart.\r\n\r\nOne fine morning, John Ferrier was about to set out to his wheatfields,\r\nwhen he heard the click of the latch, and, looking through the window,\r\nsaw a stout, sandy-haired, middle-aged man coming up the pathway. His\r\nheart leapt to his mouth, for this was none other than the great Brigham\r\nYoung himself. Full of trepidation--for he knew that such a visit boded\r\nhim little good--Ferrier ran to the door to greet the Mormon chief. The\r\nlatter, however, received his salutations coldly, and followed him with\r\na stern face into the sitting-room.\r\n\r\n\u201cBrother Ferrier,\u201d he said, taking a seat, and eyeing the farmer keenly\r\nfrom under his light-coloured eyelashes, \u201cthe true believers have been\r\ngood friends to you.

Is not this so?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is so,\u201d answered John Ferrier.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn return for all this we asked but one condition: that was, that you\r\nshould embrace the true faith, and conform in every way to its usages.\r\nThis you promised to do, and this, if common report says truly, you hav'), NULL);

This must be the gossip of idle tongues.\r\nWhat is the thirteenth rule in the code of the sainted Joseph Smith?\r\n\u2018Let every maiden of the true faith marry one of the elect; for if\r\nshe wed a Gentile, she commits a grievous sin.\u2019 This being so, it is\r\nimpossible that you, who profess the holy creed, should suffer your\r\ndaughter to violate it.\u201d\r\n\r\nJohn Ferrier made no answer, but he played nervously with his\r\nriding-whip.\r\n\r\n\u201cUpon this one point your whole faith shall be tested--so it has been\r\ndecided in the Sacred Council of Four. The girl is young, and we would\r\nnot have her wed grey hairs, neither would we deprive her of all\r\nchoice. We Elders have many heifers, [29] but our children must also\r\nbe provided. Stangerson has a son, and Drebber has a son, and either of\r\nthem would gladly welcome your daughter to their house. Let her choose\r\nbetween them. They are young and rich, and of the true faith. What say\r\nyou to that?\u201d\r\n\r\nFerrier remained silent for some little time with his brows knitted.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will give us time,\u201d he said at last. \u201cMy daughter is very\r\nyoung--she is scarce of an age to marry.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe shall have a month to choose,\u201d said Young, rising from his seat.\r\n\u201cAt the end of that time she shall give her answer.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe was passing through the door, when he turned, with flushed face and\r\nflashing eyes. \u201cIt were better for you, John Ferrier,\u201d he thundered,\r\n\u201cthat you and she were now lying blanched skeletons upon the Sierra\r\nBlanco, than that you should put your weak wills against the orders of\r\nthe Holy Four!\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a threatening gesture of his hand, he turned from the door, and\r\nFerrier heard his heavy step scrunching along the shingly path.\r\n\r\nHe was still sitting with his elbows upon his knees, considering how he\r\nshould broach the matter to his daughter when a soft hand was laid upon\r\nhis, and looking up, he saw her standing beside him. One glance at her\r\npale, frightened face showed him that she had heard what had passed.\r\n\r\n\u201cI could not help it,\u201d she said, in answer to his look. \u201cHis voice rang\r\nthrough the house. Oh, father, father, what shall we do?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you scare yourself,\u201d he answered, drawing her to him, and passing\r\nhis broad, rough hand caressingly over her chestnut hair. \u201cWe\u2019ll fix it\r\nup somehow or another.

In it he told the young man of the\r\nimminent danger which threatened them, and how necessary it was that he\r\nshould return. Having done thus he felt easier in his mind, and returned\r\nhome with a lighter heart.\r\n\r\nAs he approached his farm, he was surprised to see a horse hitched to\r\neach of the posts of the gate. Still more surprised was he on entering\r\nto find two young men in possession of his sitting-room. One, with a\r\nlong pale face, was leaning back in the rocking-chair, with his feet\r\ncocked up upon the stove. The other, a bull-necked youth with coarse\r\nbloated features, was standing in front of the window with his hands in\r\nhis pocket, whistling a popular hymn. Both of them nodded to Ferrier as\r\nhe entered, and the one in the rocking-chair commenced the conversation.\r\n\r\n\u201cMaybe you don\u2019t know us,\u201d he said. \u201cThis here is the son of Elder\r\nDrebber, and I\u2019m Joseph Stangerson, who travelled with you in the desert\r\nwhen the Lord stretched out His hand and gathered you into the true\r\nfold.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs He will all the nations in His own good time,\u201d said the other in a\r\nnasal voice; \u201cHe grindeth slowly but exceeding small.\u201d\r\n\r\nJohn Ferrier bowed coldly. He had guessed who his visitors were.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have come,\u201d continued Stangerson, \u201cat the advice of our fathers to\r\nsolicit the hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem good to\r\nyou and to her. As I have but four wives and Brother Drebber here has\r\nseven, it appears to me that my claim is the stronger one.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNay, nay, Brother Stangerson,\u201d cried the other; \u201cthe question is not\r\nhow many wives we have, but how many we can keep. My father has now\r\ngiven over his mills to me, and I am the richer man.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut my prospects are better,\u201d said the other, warmly. \u201cWhen the\r\nLord removes my father, I shall have his tanning yard and his leather\r\nfactory. Then I am your elder, and am higher in the Church.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt will be for the maiden to decide,\u201d rejoined young Drebber, smirking\r\nat his own reflection in the glass. \u201cWe will leave it all to her\r\ndecision.\u201d\r\n\r\nDuring this dialogue, John Ferrier had stood fuming in the doorway,\r\nhardly able to keep his riding-whip from the backs of his two visitors.\r\n\r\n\u201cLook here,\u201d he said at last, striding up to them, \u201cwhen my daughter\r\nsummons you, you can come, but until then I don\u2019t want to see your faces\r\nagain.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe two young Mormons stared at him in amazement.

Before he could escape from her, the clatter of horses\u2019\r\nhoofs told him that they were beyond his reach.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe young canting rascals!\u201d he exclaimed, wiping the perspiration from\r\nhis forehead; \u201cI would sooner see you in your grave, my girl, than the\r\nwife of either of them.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd so should I, father,\u201d she answered, with spirit; \u201cbut Jefferson\r\nwill soon be here.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes. It will not be long before he comes. The sooner the better, for we\r\ndo not know what their next move may be.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, high time that someone capable of giving advice and\r\nhelp should come to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his adopted\r\ndaughter. In the whole history of the settlement there had never been\r\nsuch a case of rank disobedience to the authority of the Elders. If\r\nminor errors were punished so sternly, what would be the fate of this\r\narch rebel. Ferrier knew that his wealth and position would be of no\r\navail to him. Others as well known and as rich as himself had been\r\nspirited away before now, and their goods given over to the Church. He\r\nwas a brave man, but he trembled at the vague, shadowy terrors which\r\nhung over him. Any known danger he could face with a firm lip, but\r\nthis suspense was unnerving. He concealed his fears from his daughter,\r\nhowever, and affected to make light of the whole matter, though she,\r\nwith the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at ease.\r\n\r\nHe expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from\r\nYoung as to his conduct, and he was not mistaken, though it came in an\r\nunlooked-for manner. Upon rising next morning he found, to his surprise,\r\na small square of paper pinned on to the coverlet of his bed just over\r\nhis chest. On it was printed, in bold straggling letters:--\r\n\r\n\u201cTwenty-nine days are given you for amendment, and then----\u201d\r\n\r\nThe dash was more fear-inspiring than any threat could have been. How\r\nthis warning came into his room puzzled John Ferrier sorely, for his\r\nservants slept in an outhouse, and the doors and windows had all been\r\nsecured. He crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his daughter, but\r\nthe incident struck a chill into his heart. The twenty-nine days were\r\nevidently the balance of the month which Young had promised. What\r\nstrength or courage could avail against an enemy armed with such\r\nmysterious powers? The hand which fastened that pin might have struck\r\nhim to the heart, and he could never have known who had slain him.\r\n\r\nStill more shaken was he next morning. They had sat down to their\r\nbreakfast when Lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards. In the\r\ncentre of the ceiling was scrawled, with a burned stick apparently,\r\nthe number 28. To his daughter it was unintelligible, and he did not\r\nenlighten her. That night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and\r\nward. He saw and he heard nothing, and yet in the morning a great 27 had\r\nbeen painted upon the outside of his door.\r\n\r\nThus day followed day; and as sure as morning came he found that his\r\nunseen enemies had kept their register, and had marked up in some\r\nconspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the\r\nmonth of grace. Sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls,\r\nsometimes upon the floors, occasionally they were on small placards\r\nstuck upon the garden gate or the railings. With all his vigilance John\r\nFerrier could not discover whence these daily warnings proceeded. A\r\n'), NULL);

He became haggard and restless, and his eyes had the troubled look\r\nof some hunted creature. He had but one hope in life now, and that was\r\nfor the arrival of the young hunter from Nevada.\r\n\r\nTwenty had changed to fifteen and fifteen to ten, but there was no news\r\nof the absentee. One by one the numbers dwindled down, and still there\r\ncame no sign of him. Whenever a horseman clattered down the road, or a\r\ndriver shouted at his team, the old farmer hurried to the gate thinking\r\nthat help had arrived at last. At last, when he saw five give way to\r\nfour and that again to three, he lost heart, and abandoned all hope of\r\nescape. Single-handed, and with his limited knowledge of the mountains\r\nwhich surrounded the settlement, he knew that he was powerless. The\r\nmore-frequented roads were strictly watched and guarded, and none could\r\npass along them without an order from the Council. Turn which way he\r\nwould, there appeared to be no avoiding the blow which hung over him.\r\nYet the old man never wavered in his resolution to part with life itself\r\nbefore he consented to what he regarded as his daughter\u2019s dishonour.\r\n\r\nHe was sitting alone one evening pondering deeply over his troubles, and\r\nsearching vainly for some way out of them. That morning had shown the\r\nfigure 2 upon the wall of his house, and the next day would be the last\r\nof the allotted time. What was to happen then? All manner of vague and\r\nterrible fancies filled his imagination. And his daughter--what was to\r\nbecome of her after he was gone? Was there no escape from the invisible\r\nnetwork which was drawn all round them. He sank his head upon the table\r\nand sobbed at the thought of his own impotence.\r\n\r\nWhat was that? In the silence he heard a gentle scratching sound--low,\r\nbut very distinct in the quiet of the night. It came from the door of\r\nthe house. Ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently. There\r\nwas a pause for a few moments, and then the low insidious sound was\r\nrepeated. Someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the\r\npanels of the door. Was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry\r\nout the murderous orders of the secret tribunal? Or was it some agent\r\nwho was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived. John Ferrier\r\nfelt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook\r\nhis nerves and chilled his heart. Springing forward he drew the bolt and\r\nthrew the door open.\r\n\r\nOutside all was calm and quiet. The night was fine, and the stars were\r\ntwinkling brightly overhead. The little front garden lay before the\r\nfarmer\u2019s eyes bounded by the fence and gate, but neither there nor on\r\nthe road was any human being to be seen. With a sigh of relief, Ferrier\r\nlooked to right and to left, until happening to glance straight down at\r\nhis own feet he saw to his astonishment a man lying flat upon his face\r\nupon the ground, with arms and legs all asprawl.\r\n\r\nSo unnerved was he at the sight that he leaned up against the wall with\r\nhis hand to his throat to stifle his inclination to call out. His first\r\nthought was that the prostrate figure was that of some wounded or dying\r\nman, but as he watched it he saw it writhe along the ground and into the\r\nhall with the rapidity and noiselessness of a serpent. Once within the\r\nhouse the man sprang to his feet, closed the door, and revealed to the\r\nastonished farmer the fierce face and resolute expression of Jefferson\r\nHope.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood God!\u201d gasped John Ferrier. \u201cHow you scared me!

He had\r\nhardly completed his arrangements before the farmer returned with his\r\ndaughter all dressed and ready for a start. The greeting between the\r\nlovers was warm, but brief, for minutes were precious, and there was\r\nmuch to be done.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must make our start at once,\u201d said Jefferson Hope, speaking in a low\r\nbut resolute voice, like one who realizes the greatness of the peril,\r\nbut has steeled his heart to meet it. \u201cThe front and back entrances are\r\nwatched, but with caution we may get away through the side window and\r\nacross the fields.

By daybreak we should be half-way\r\nthrough the mountains.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat if we are stopped,\u201d asked Ferrier.\r\n\r\nHope slapped the revolver butt which protruded from the front of his\r\ntunic. \u201cIf they are too many for us we shall take two or three of them\r\nwith us,\u201d he said with a sinister smile.\r\n\r\nThe lights inside the house had all been extinguished, and from the\r\ndarkened window Ferrier peered over the fields which had been his own,\r\nand which he was now about to abandon for ever. He had long nerved\r\nhimself to the sacrifice, however, and the thought of the honour and\r\nhappiness of his daughter outweighed any regret at his ruined fortunes.\r\nAll looked so peaceful and happy, the rustling trees and the broad\r\nsilent stretch of grain-land, that it was difficult to realize that\r\nthe spirit of murder lurked through it all. Yet the white face and set\r\nexpression of the young hunter showed that in his approach to the house\r\nhe had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head.\r\n\r\nFerrier carried the bag of gold and notes, Jefferson Hope had the scanty\r\nprovisions and water, while Lucy had a small bundle containing a few\r\nof her more valued possessions. Opening the window very slowly and\r\ncarefully, they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the\r\nnight, and then one by one passed through into the little garden. With\r\nbated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it, and gained\r\nthe shelter of the hedge, which they skirted until they came to the gap\r\nwhich opened into the cornfields. They had just reached this point when\r\nthe young man seized his two companions and dragged them down into the\r\nshadow, where they lay silent and trembling.\r\n\r\nIt was as well that his prairie training had given Jefferson Hope the\r\nears of a lynx.

Their concluding words had evidently been some\r\nform of sign and countersign. The instant that their footsteps had died\r\naway in the distance, Jefferson Hope sprang to his feet, and helping his\r\ncompanions through the gap, led the way across the fields at the top\r\nof his speed, supporting and half-carrying the girl when her strength\r\nappeared to fail her.\r\n\r\n\u201cHurry on! hurry on!\u201d he gasped from time to time. \u201cWe are through the\r\nline of sentinels.

Only once did they\r\nmeet anyone, and then they managed to slip into a field, and so avoid\r\nrecognition. Before reaching the town the hunter branched away into a\r\nrugged and narrow footpath which led to the mountains. Two dark jagged\r\npeaks loomed above them through the darkness, and the defile which led\r\nbetween them was the Eagle Ca\u00f1on in which the horses were awaiting them.\r\nWith unerring instinct Jefferson Hope picked his way among the great\r\nboulders and along the bed of a dried-up watercourse, until he came to\r\nthe retired corner, screened with rocks, where the faithful animals had\r\nbeen picketed. The girl was placed upon the mule, and old Ferrier upon\r\none of the horses, with his money-bag, while Jefferson Hope led the\r\nother along the precipitous and dangerous path.\r\n\r\nIt was a bewildering route for anyone who was not accustomed to face\r\nNature in her wildest moods. On the one side a great crag towered up a\r\nthousand feet or more, black, stern, and menacing, with long basaltic\r\ncolumns upon its rugged surface like the ribs of some petrified monster.\r\nOn the other hand a wild chaos of boulders and debris made all advance\r\nimpossible. Between the two ran the irregular track, so narrow in places\r\nthat they had to travel in Indian file, and so rough that only practised\r\nriders could have traversed it at all. Yet in spite of all dangers and\r\ndifficulties, the hearts of the fugitives were light within them,\r\nfor every step increased the distance between them and the terrible\r\ndespotism from which they were flying.\r\n\r\nThey soon had a proof, however, that they were still within the\r\njurisdiction of the Saints. They had reached the very wildest and most\r\ndesolate portion of the pass when the girl gave a startled cry, and\r\npointed upwards. On a rock which overlooked the track, showing out dark\r\nand plain against the sky, there stood a solitary sentinel. He saw them\r\nas soon as they perceived him, and his military challenge of \u201cWho goes\r\nthere?\u201d rang through the silent ravine.\r\n\r\n\u201cTravellers for Nevada,\u201d said Jefferson Hope, with his hand upon the\r\nrifle which hung by his saddle.\r\n\r\nThey could see the lonely watcher fingering his gun, and peering down at\r\nthem as if dissatisfied at their reply.\r\n\r\n\u201cBy whose permission?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Holy Four,\u201d answered Ferrier.

In every direction the great snow-capped peaks\r\nhemmed them in, peeping over each other\u2019s shoulders to the far horizon.\r\nSo steep were the rocky banks on either side of them, that the larch\r\nand the pine seemed to be suspended over their heads, and to need only a\r\ngust of wind to come hurtling down upon them. Nor was the fear entirely\r\nan illusion, for the barren valley was thickly strewn with trees and\r\nboulders which had fallen in a similar manner. Even as they passed,\r\na great rock came thundering down with a hoarse rattle which woke\r\nthe echoes in the silent gorges, and startled the weary horses into a\r\ngallop.\r\n\r\nAs the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon, the caps of the great\r\nmountains lit up one after the other, like lamps at a festival, until\r\nthey were all ruddy and glowing. The magnificent spectacle cheered the\r\nhearts of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy. At a wild\r\ntorrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and watered their\r\nhorses, while they partook of a hasty breakfast. Lucy and her father\r\nwould fain have rested longer, but Jefferson Hope was inexorable. \u201cThey\r\nwill be upon our track by this time,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything depends upon\r\nour speed.

At night-time they chose the base of a beetling crag,\r\nwhere the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind, and there\r\nhuddled together for warmth, they enjoyed a few hours\u2019 sleep. Before\r\ndaybreak, however, they were up and on their way once more. They had\r\nseen no signs of any pursuers, and Jefferson Hope began to think that\r\nthey were fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whose\r\nenmity they had incurred. He little knew how far that iron grasp could\r\nreach, or how soon it was to close upon them and crush them.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store\r\nof provisions began to run out. This gave the hunter little uneasiness,\r\nhowever, for there was game to be had among the mountains, and he had\r\nfrequently before had to depend upon his rifle for the needs of life.\r\nChoosing a sheltered nook, he piled together a few dried branches and\r\nmade a blazing fire, at which his companions might warm themselves, for\r\nthey were now nearly five thousand feet above the sea level, and the air\r\nwas bitter and keen. Having tethered the horses, and bade Lucy adieu,\r\nhe threw his gun over his shoulder, and set out in search of whatever\r\nchance might throw in his way. Looking back he saw the old man and the\r\nyoung girl crouching over the blazing fire, while the three animals\r\nstood motionless in the back-ground. Then the intervening rocks hid them\r\nfrom his view.\r\n\r\nHe walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another without\r\nsuccess, though from the marks upon the bark of the trees, and other\r\nindications, he judged that there were numerous bears in the vicinity.\r\nAt last, after two or three hours\u2019 fruitless search, he was thinking of\r\nturning back in despair, when casting his eyes upwards he saw a sight\r\nwhich sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart. On the edge of a\r\njutting pinnacle, three or four hundred feet above him, there stood a\r\ncreature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance, but armed with a\r\npair of gigantic horns. The big-horn--for so it is called--was acting,\r\nprobably, as a guardian over a flock which were invisible to the hunter;\r\nbut fortunately it was heading in the opposite direction, and had not\r\nperceived him. Lying on his face, he rested his rifle upon a rock, and\r\ntook a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger.

With this trophy\r\nover his shoulder, he hastened to retrace his steps, for the evening was\r\nalready drawing in. He had hardly started, however, before he realized\r\nthe difficulty which faced him. In his eagerness he had wandered far\r\npast the ravines which were known to him, and it was no easy matter\r\nto pick out the path which he had taken. The valley in which he found\r\nhimself divided and sub-divided into many gorges, which were so like\r\neach other that it was impossible to distinguish one from the other.\r\nHe followed one for a mile or more until he came to a mountain torrent\r\nwhich he was sure that he had never seen before. Convinced that he had\r\ntaken the wrong turn, he tried another, but with the same result. Night\r\nwas coming on rapidly, and it was almost dark before he at last found\r\nhimself in a defile which was familiar to him. Even then it was no easy\r\nmatter to keep to the right track, for the moon had not yet risen, and\r\nthe high cliffs on either side made the obscurity more profound. Weighed\r\ndown with his burden, and weary from his exertions, he stumbled along,\r\nkeeping up his heart by the reflection that every step brought him\r\nnearer to Lucy, and that he carried with him enough to ensure them food\r\nfor the remainder of their journey.\r\n\r\nHe had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left\r\nthem. Even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs\r\nwhich bounded it. They must, he reflected, be awaiting him anxiously,\r\nfor he had been absent nearly five hours. In the gladness of his heart\r\nhe put his hands to his mouth and made the glen re-echo to a loud halloo\r\nas a signal that he was coming. He paused and listened for an answer.\r\nNone came save his own cry, which clattered up the dreary silent\r\nravines, and was borne back to his ears in countless repetitions. Again\r\nhe shouted, even louder than before, and again no whisper came back from\r\nthe friends whom he had left such a short time ago. A vague, nameless\r\ndread came over him, and he hurried onwards frantically, dropping the\r\nprecious food in his agitation.\r\n\r\nWhen he turned the corner, he came full in sight of the spot where the\r\nfire had been lit. There was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there,\r\nbut it had evidently not been tended since his departure. The same\r\ndead silence still reigned all round. With his fears all changed to\r\nconvictions, he hurried on. There was no living creature near the\r\nremains of the fire: animals, man, maiden, all were gone. It was only\r\ntoo clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during\r\nhis absence--a disaster which had embraced them all, and yet had left no\r\ntraces behind it.\r\n\r\nBewildered and stunned by this blow, Jefferson Hope felt his head spin\r\nround, and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling. He\r\nwas essentially a man of action, however, and speedily recovered from\r\nhis temporary impotence. Seizing a half-consumed piece of wood from the\r\nsmouldering fire, he blew it into a flame, and proceeded with its help\r\nto examine the little camp. The ground was all stamped down by the feet\r\nof horses, showing that a large party of mounted men had overtaken\r\nthe fugitives, and the direction of their tracks proved that they had\r\nafterwards turned back to Salt Lake City. Had they carried back both of\r\nhis companions with them? Jefferson Hope had almost persuaded himself\r\nthat they must have done so, when his eye fell upon an object which made\r\nevery nerve of his body tingle within him. A little way on one side of\r\nthe camp was a low-lying heap of reddish soil, which had assuredly\r\nnot been there before. There was no mistaking it for anything but a\r\nnewly-dug grave. As the young hunter approached it, he perceived that a\r\nstick had been planted on it, with a sheet of paper stuck in the cleft\r\nfork of it. The inscription upon the paper was brief, but to the point:\r\n\r\n                        JOHN FERRIER,\r\n                 FORMERLY OF SALT LAKE CITY, [22]\r\n                    Died August 4th, 1860.\r\n\r\nThe sturdy old man, whom he '), NULL);

Jefferson Hope looked wildly round\r\nto see if there was a second grave, but there was no sign of one. Lucy\r\nhad been carried back by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her original\r\ndestiny, by becoming one of the harem of the Elder\u2019s son. As the young\r\nfellow realized the certainty of her fate, and his own powerlessness to\r\nprevent it, he wished that he, too, was lying with the old farmer in his\r\nlast silent resting-place.\r\n\r\nAgain, however, his active spirit shook off the lethargy which springs\r\nfrom despair. If there was nothing else left to him, he could at least\r\ndevote his life to revenge. With indomitable patience and perseverance,\r\nJefferson Hope possessed also a power of sustained vindictiveness, which\r\nhe may have learned from the Indians amongst whom he had lived. As he\r\nstood by the desolate fire, he felt that the only one thing which could\r\nassuage his grief would be thorough and complete retribution, brought\r\nby his own hand upon his enemies. His strong will and untiring energy\r\nshould, he determined, be devoted to that one end. With a grim, white\r\nface, he retraced his steps to where he had dropped the food, and having\r\nstirred up the smouldering fire, he cooked enough to last him for a\r\nfew days. This he made up into a bundle, and, tired as he was, he\r\nset himself to walk back through the mountains upon the track of the\r\navenging angels.\r\n\r\nFor five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he\r\nhad already traversed on horseback. At night he flung himself down among\r\nthe rocks, and snatched a few hours of sleep; but before daybreak he was\r\nalways well on his way. On the sixth day, he reached the Eagle Ca\u00f1on,\r\nfrom which they had commenced their ill-fated flight. Thence he could\r\nlook down upon the home of the saints. Worn and exhausted, he leaned\r\nupon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent\r\nwidespread city beneath him. As he looked at it, he observed that\r\nthere were flags in some of the principal streets, and other signs of\r\nfestivity. He was still speculating as to what this might mean when he\r\nheard the clatter of horse\u2019s hoofs, and saw a mounted man riding towards\r\nhim. As he approached, he recognized him as a Mormon named Cowper, to\r\nwhom he had rendered services at different times. He therefore accosted\r\nhim when he got up to him, with the object of finding out what Lucy\r\nFerrier\u2019s fate had been.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am Jefferson Hope,\u201d he said. \u201cYou remember me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Mormon looked at him with undisguised astonishment--indeed, it was\r\ndifficult to recognize in this tattered, unkempt wanderer, with ghastly\r\nwhite face and fierce, wild eyes, the spruce young hunter of former\r\ndays. Having, however, at last, satisfied himself as to his identity,\r\nthe man\u2019s surprise changed to consternation.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are mad to come here,\u201d he cried. \u201cIt is as much as my own life is\r\nworth to be seen talking with you. There is a warrant against you from\r\nthe Holy Four for assisting the Ferriers away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t fear them, or their warrant,\u201d Hope said, earnestly. \u201cYou must\r\nknow something of this matter, Cowper. I conjure you by everything you\r\nhold dear to answer a few questions. We have always been friends. For\r\nGod\u2019s sake, don\u2019t refuse to answer me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d the Mormon asked uneasily. \u201cBe quick. The very rocks have\r\nears and the trees eyes.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat has become of Lucy Ferrier?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShe was married yesterday to young Drebber. Hold up, man, hold up, you\r\nhave no life left in you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind me,\u201d said Hope faintly. He was white to the very lips, and\r\nhad sunk down on the stone against which he had been leaning. \u201cMarried,\r\nyou say?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMarried yesterday--that\u2019s what those flags are for on the Endowment\r\nHouse. There was some words between young Drebber and young Stangerson\r\nas to which was to have her. They\u2019d both been in the party that followed\r\nthem, and Stangerson had shot her father, which seemed to give him the\r\nbest claim; but when they argued it out in council, Drebber\u2019s party was\r\nthe stronger, '), NULL);

His\r\nface might have been chiselled out of marble, so hard and set was its\r\nexpression, while its eyes glowed with a baleful light.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d he answered; and, slinging his weapon over his shoulder,\r\nstrode off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the mountains to\r\nthe haunts of the wild beasts. Amongst them all there was none so fierce\r\nand so dangerous as himself.\r\n\r\nThe prediction of the Mormon was only too well fulfilled. Whether it was\r\nthe terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful marriage\r\ninto which she had been forced, poor Lucy never held up her head again,\r\nbut pined away and died within a month. Her sottish husband, who had\r\nmarried her principally for the sake of John Ferrier\u2019s property, did not\r\naffect any great grief at his bereavement; but his other wives mourned\r\nover her, and sat up with her the night before the burial, as is the\r\nMormon custom. They were grouped round the bier in the early hours of\r\nthe morning, when, to their inexpressible fear and astonishment,\r\nthe door was flung open, and a savage-looking, weather-beaten man in\r\ntattered garments strode into the room. Without a glance or a word to\r\nthe cowering women, he walked up to the white silent figure which had\r\nonce contained the pure soul of Lucy Ferrier. Stooping over her, he\r\npressed his lips reverently to her cold forehead, and then, snatching\r\nup her hand, he took the wedding-ring from her finger. \u201cShe shall not be\r\nburied in that,\u201d he cried with a fierce snarl, and before an alarm could\r\nbe raised sprang down the stairs and was gone. So strange and so brief\r\nwas the episode, that the watchers might have found it hard to believe\r\nit themselves or persuade other people of it, had it not been for the\r\nundeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as having been\r\na bride had disappeared.\r\n\r\nFor some months Jefferson Hope lingered among the mountains, leading\r\na strange wild life, and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for\r\nvengeance which possessed him. Tales were told in the City of the weird\r\nfigure which was seen prowling about the suburbs, and which haunted\r\nthe lonely mountain gorges. Once a bullet whistled through Stangerson\u2019s\r\nwindow and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot of him. On\r\nanother occasion, as Drebber passed under a cliff a great boulder\r\ncrashed down on him, and he only escaped a terrible death by throwing\r\nhimself upon his face. The two young Mormons were not long in\r\ndiscovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives, and led\r\nrepeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or\r\nkilling their enemy, but always without success. Then they adopted the\r\nprecaution of never going out alone or after nightfall, and of having\r\ntheir houses guarded. After a time they were able to relax these\r\nmeasures, for nothing was either heard or seen of their opponent, and\r\nthey hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness.\r\n\r\nFar from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented it. The hunter\u2019s mind\r\nwas of a hard, unyielding nature, and the predominant idea of revenge\r\nhad taken such complete possession of it that there was no room for\r\nany other emotion. He was, however, above all things practical. He soon\r\nrealized that even his iron constitution could not stand the incessant\r\nstrain which he was putting upon it. Exposure and want of wholesome food\r\nwere wearing him out. If he died like a dog among the mountains, what\r\nwas to become of his revenge then? And yet such a death was sure to\r\novertake him if he persisted. He felt that that was to play his enemy\u2019s\r\ngame, so he reluctantly returned to the old Nevada mines, there to\r\nrecruit his health and to amass money enough to allow him to pursue his\r\nobject without privation.\r\n\r\nHis intention had been to be absent a year at the most, but a\r\ncom'), NULL);

At the end of that time, however, his memory of\r\nhis wrongs and his craving for revenge were quite as keen as on that\r\nmemorable night when he had stood by John Ferrier\u2019s grave. Disguised,\r\nand under an assumed name, he returned to Salt Lake City, careless\r\nwhat became of his own life, as long as he obtained what he knew to\r\nbe justice. There he found evil tidings awaiting him. There had been a\r\nschism among the Chosen People a few months before, some of the younger\r\nmembers of the Church having rebelled against the authority of the\r\nElders, and the result had been the secession of a certain number of the\r\nmalcontents, who had left Utah and become Gentiles. Among these had been\r\nDrebber and Stangerson; and no one knew whither they had gone. Rumour\r\nreported that Drebber had managed to convert a large part of his\r\nproperty into money, and that he had departed a wealthy man, while his\r\ncompanion, Stangerson, was comparatively poor. There was no clue at all,\r\nhowever, as to their whereabouts.\r\n\r\nMany a man, however vindictive, would have abandoned all thought of\r\nrevenge in the face of such a difficulty, but Jefferson Hope never\r\nfaltered for a moment. With the small competence he possessed, eked out\r\nby such employment as he could pick up, he travelled from town to town\r\nthrough the United States in quest of his enemies. Year passed into\r\nyear, his black hair turned grizzled, but still he wandered on, a human\r\nbloodhound, with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon which he\r\nhad devoted his life. At last his perseverance was rewarded. It was\r\nbut a glance of a face in a window, but that one glance told him that\r\nCleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit of. He\r\nreturned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance all\r\narranged. It chanced, however, that Drebber, looking from his window,\r\nhad recognized the vagrant in the street, and had read murder in\r\nhis eyes. He hurried before a justice of the peace, accompanied by\r\nStangerson, who had become his private secretary, and represented to him\r\nthat they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and hatred of\r\nan old rival. That evening Jefferson Hope was taken into custody, and\r\nnot being able to find sureties, was detained for some weeks. When at\r\nlast he was liberated, it was only to find that Drebber\u2019s house was\r\ndeserted, and that he and his secretary had departed for Europe.\r\n\r\nAgain the avenger had been foiled, and again his concentrated hatred\r\nurged him to continue the pursuit. Funds were wanting, however, and\r\nfor some time he had to return to work, saving every dollar for his\r\napproaching journey. At last, having collected enough to keep life in\r\nhim, he departed for Europe, and tracked his enemies from city to\r\ncity, working his way in any menial capacity, but never overtaking the\r\nfugitives. When he reached St. Petersburg they had departed for Paris;\r\nand when he followed them there he learned that they had just set off\r\nfor Copenhagen. At the Danish capital he was again a few days late, for\r\nthey had journeyed on to London, where he at last succeeded in running\r\nthem to earth.

We were ushered into\r\na small chamber where a police Inspector noted down our prisoner\u2019s name\r\nand the names of the men with whose murder he had been charged. The\r\nofficial was a white-faced unemotional man, who went through his\r\nduties in a dull mechanical way. \u201cThe prisoner will be put before the\r\nmagistrates in the course of the week,\u201d he said; \u201cin the mean time, Mr.\r\nJefferson Hope, have you anything that you wish to say? I must warn you\r\nthat your words will be taken down, and may be used against you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a good deal to say,\u201d our prisoner said slowly. \u201cI want to tell\r\nyou gentlemen all about it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHadn\u2019t you better reserve that for your trial?\u201d asked the Inspector.\r\n\r\n\u201cI may never be tried,\u201d he answered. \u201cYou needn\u2019t look startled.

The walls of his chest seemed to\r\nthrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside when some powerful\r\nengine was at work.

It has been getting worse for years. I got it from over-exposure\r\nand under-feeding among the Salt Lake Mountains.

When I got to London my pocket was about empty, and I found\r\nthat I must turn my hand to something for my living. Driving and riding\r\nare as natural to me as walking, so I applied at a cabowner\u2019s office,\r\nand soon got employment. I was to bring a certain sum a week to the\r\nowner, and whatever was over that I might keep for myself. There was\r\nseldom much over, but I managed to scrape along somehow. The hardest job\r\nwas to learn my way about, for I reckon that of all the mazes that ever\r\nwere contrived, this city is the most confusing. I had a map beside me\r\nthough, and when once I had spotted the principal hotels and stations, I\r\ngot on pretty well.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were living;\r\nbut I inquired and inquired until at last I dropped across them. They\r\nwere at a boarding-house at Camberwell, over on the other side of the\r\nriver. When once I found them out I knew that I had them at my mercy. I\r\nhad grown my beard, and there was no chance of their recognizing me.\r\nI would dog them and follow them until I saw my opportunity. I was\r\ndetermined that they should not escape me again.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey were very near doing it for all that. Go where they would about\r\nLondon, I was always at their heels. Sometimes I followed them on my\r\ncab, and sometimes on foot, but the former was the best, for then they\r\ncould not get away from me. It was only early in the morning or late\r\nat night that I could earn anything, so that I began to get behind hand\r\nwith my employer. I did not mind that, however, as long as I could lay\r\nmy hand upon the men I wanted.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey were very cunning, though. They must have thought that there was\r\nsome chance of their being followed, for they would never go out alone,\r\nand never after nightfall. During two weeks I drove behind them every\r\nday, and never once saw them separate. Drebber himself was drunk half\r\nthe time, but Stangerson was not to be caught napping. I watched them\r\nlate and early, but never saw the ghost of a chance; but I was not\r\ndiscouraged, for something told me that the hour had almost come. My\r\nonly fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a little too soon\r\nand leave my work undone.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt last, one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace, as the\r\nstreet was called in which they boarded, when I saw a cab drive up to\r\ntheir door. Presently some luggage was brought out, and after a time\r\nDrebber and Stangerson followed it, and drove off.

I got so close to them in the bustle that I could hear\r\nevery word that passed between them. Drebber said that he had a little\r\nbusiness of his own to do, and that if the other would wait for him he\r\nwould soon rejoin him. His companion remonstrated with him, and reminded\r\nhim that they had resolved to stick together. Drebber answered that the\r\nmatter was a delicate one, and that he must go alone. I could not catch\r\nwhat Stangerson said to that, but the other burst out swearing, and\r\nreminded him that he was nothing more than his paid servant, and that he\r\nmust not presume to dictate to him. On that the Secretary gave it up\r\nas a bad job, and simply bargained with him that if he missed the last\r\ntrain he should rejoin him at Halliday\u2019s Private Hotel; to which Drebber\r\nanswered that he would be back on the platform before eleven, and made\r\nhis way out of the station.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe moment for which I had waited so long had at last come. I had my\r\nenemies within my power. Together they could protect each other,\r\nbut singly they were at my mercy. I did not act, however, with undue\r\nprecipitation. My plans were already formed. There is no satisfaction in\r\nvengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that strikes\r\nhim, and why retribution has come upon him. I had my plans arranged by\r\nwhich I should have the opportunity of making the man who had wronged me\r\nunderstand that his old sin had found him out. It chanced that some days\r\nbefore a gentleman who had been engaged in looking over some houses in\r\nthe Brixton Road had dropped the key of one of them in my carriage. It\r\nwas claimed that same evening, and returned; but in the interval I had\r\ntaken a moulding of it, and had a duplicate constructed. By means of\r\nthis I had access to at least one spot in this great city where I could\r\nrely upon being free from interruption.

I followed it so close\r\nthat the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the whole way.\r\nWe rattled across Waterloo Bridge and through miles of streets, until,\r\nto my astonishment, we found ourselves back in the Terrace in which he\r\nhad boarded. I could not imagine what his intention was in returning\r\nthere; but I went on and pulled up my cab a hundred yards or so from\r\nthe house. He entered it, and his hansom drove away.

One day the professor was\r\nlecturing on poisions, [25] and he showed his students some alkaloid,\r\nas he called it, which he had extracted from some South American arrow\r\npoison, and which was so powerful that the least grain meant instant\r\ndeath. I spotted the bottle in which this preparation was kept, and when\r\nthey were all gone, I helped myself to a little of it. I was a fairly\r\ngood dispenser, so I worked this alkaloid into small, soluble pills, and\r\neach pill I put in a box with a similar pill made without the poison.\r\nI determined at the time that when I had my chance, my gentlemen should\r\neach have a draw out of one of these boxes, while I ate the pill that\r\nremained. It would be quite as deadly, and a good deal less noisy than\r\nfiring across a handkerchief. From that day I had always my pill boxes\r\nabout with me, and the time had now come when I was to use them.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was nearer one than twelve, and a wild, bleak night, blowing hard\r\nand raining in torrents. Dismal as it was outside, I was glad within--so\r\nglad that I could have shouted out from pure exultation. If any of you\r\ngentlemen have ever pined for a thing, and longed for it during twenty\r\nlong years, and then suddenly found it within your reach, you would\r\nunderstand my feelings. I lit a cigar, and puffed at it to steady my\r\nnerves, but my hands were trembling, and my temples throbbing with\r\nexcitement. As I drove, I could see old John Ferrier and sweet Lucy\r\nlooking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me, just as plain as I\r\nsee you all in this room. All the way they were ahead of me, one on each\r\nside of the horse until I pulled up at the house in the Brixton Road.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was not a soul to be seen, nor a sound to be heard, except the\r\ndripping of the rain. When I looked in at the window, I found Drebber\r\nall huddled together in a drunken sleep. I shook him by the arm, \u2018It\u2019s\r\ntime to get out,\u2019 I said.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018All right, cabby,\u2019 said he.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mentioned,\r\nfor he got out without another word, and followed me down the garden.\r\nI had to walk beside him to keep him steady, for he was still a little\r\ntop-heavy. When we came to the door, I opened it, and led him into the\r\nfront room. I give you my word that all the way, the father and the\r\ndaughter were walking in front of us.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018It\u2019s infernally dark,\u2019 said he, stamping about.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018We\u2019ll soon have a light,\u2019 I said, striking a match and putting it to\r\na wax candle which I had brought with me. \u2018Now, Enoch Drebber,\u2019 I\r\ncontinued, turning to him, and holding the light to my own face, \u2018who am\r\nI?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cHe gazed at me with bleared, drunken eyes for a moment, and then I\r\nsaw a horror spring up in them, and convulse his whole features, which\r\nshowed me that he knew me. He staggered back with a livid face, and I\r\nsaw the perspiration break out upon his brow, while his teeth chattered\r\nin his head. At the sight, I leaned my back against the door and laughed\r\nloud and long. I had always known that vengeance would be sweet, but I\r\nhad never hoped for the contentment of soul which now possessed me.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2018You dog!\u2019 I said; \u2018I have hunted you from Salt Lake City to St.\r\nPetersburg, and you have always es'), NULL);

Let us see if there is justice upon the earth, or if we are ruled\r\nby chance.\u2019\r\n\r\n\u201cHe cowered away with wild cries and prayers for mercy, but I drew my\r\nknife and held it to his throat until he had obeyed me. Then I swallowed\r\nthe other, and we stood facing one another in silence for a minute or\r\nmore, waiting to see which was to live and which was to die. Shall I\r\never forget the look which came over his face when the first warning\r\npangs told him that the poison was in his system? I laughed as I saw\r\nit, and held Lucy\u2019s marriage ring in front of his eyes. It was but for\r\na moment, for the action of the alkaloid is rapid. A spasm of pain\r\ncontorted his features; he threw his hands out in front of him,\r\nstaggered, and then, with a hoarse cry, fell heavily upon the floor. I\r\nturned him over with my foot, and placed my hand upon his heart. There\r\nwas no movement. He was dead!\r\n\r\n\u201cThe blood had been streaming from my nose, but I had taken no notice of\r\nit. I don\u2019t know what it was that put it into my head to write upon the\r\nwall with it. Perhaps it was some mischievous idea of setting the police\r\nupon a wrong track, for I felt light-hearted and cheerful. I remembered\r\na German being found in New York with RACHE written up above him, and it\r\nwas argued at the time in the newspapers that the secret societies must\r\nhave done it. I guessed that what puzzled the New Yorkers would puzzle\r\nthe Londoners, so I dipped my finger in my own blood and printed it on\r\na convenient place on the wall. Then I walked down to my cab and found\r\nthat there was nobody about, and that the night was still very wild. I\r\nhad driven some distance when I put my hand into the pocket in which\r\nI usually kept Lucy\u2019s ring, and found that it was not there. I was\r\nthunderstruck at this, for it was the only memento that I had of her.\r\nThinking that I might have dropped it when I stooped over Drebber\u2019s\r\nbody, I drove back, and leaving my cab in a side street, I went boldly\r\nup to the house--for I was ready to dare anything rather than lose\r\nthe ring. When I arrived there, I walked right into the arms of a\r\npolice-officer who was coming out, and only managed to disarm his\r\nsuspicions by pretending to be hopelessly drunk.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was how Enoch Drebber came to his end. All I had to do then was\r\nto do as much for Stangerson, and so pay off John Ferrier\u2019s debt. I knew\r\nthat he was staying at Halliday\u2019s Private Hotel, and I hung about all\r\nday, but he never came out.

Instead of grasping at the chance of\r\nsafety which that offered him, he sprang from his bed and flew at my\r\nthroat. In self-defence I stabbed him to the heart.

In solving a problem of this\r\nsort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backwards. That is a very\r\nuseful accomplishment, and a very easy one, but people do not practise\r\nit much. In the every-day affairs of life it is more useful to reason\r\nforwards, and so the other comes to be neglected. There are fifty who\r\ncan reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI confess,\u201d said I, \u201cthat I do not quite follow you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hardly expected that you would. Let me see if I can make it clearer.\r\nMost people, if you describe a train of events to them, will tell you\r\nwhat the result would be. They can put those events together in their\r\nminds, and argue from them that something will come to pass. There are\r\nfew people, however, who, if you told them a result, would be able to\r\nevolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led\r\nup to that result. This power is what I mean when I talk of reasoning\r\nbackwards, or analytically.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI understand,\u201d said I.\r\n\r\n\u201cNow this was a case in which you were given the result and had to\r\nfind everything else for yourself. Now let me endeavour to show you the\r\ndifferent steps in my reasoning. To begin at the beginning. I approached\r\nthe house, as you know, on foot, and with my mind entirely free from all\r\nimpressions. I naturally began by examining the roadway, and there, as I\r\nhave already explained to you, I saw clearly the marks of a cab, which,\r\nI ascertained by inquiry, must have been there during the night. I\r\nsatisfied myself that it was a cab and not a private carriage by the\r\nnarrow gauge of the wheels. The ordinary London growler is considerably\r\nless wide than a gentleman\u2019s brougham.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis was the first point gained. I then walked slowly down the garden\r\npath, which happened to be composed of a clay soil, peculiarly suitable\r\nfor taking impressions. No doubt it appeared to you to be a mere\r\ntrampled line of slush, but to my trained eyes every mark upon its\r\nsurface had a meaning. There is no branch of detective science which\r\nis so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps.\r\nHappily, I have always laid great stress upon it, and much practice\r\nhas made it second nature to me. I saw the heavy footmarks of the\r\nconstables, but I saw also the track of the two men who had first passed\r\nthrough the garden. It was easy to tell that they had been before the\r\nothers, because in places their marks had been entirely obliterated by\r\nthe others coming upon the top of them. In this way my second link was\r\nformed, which told me that the nocturnal visitors were two in number,\r\none remarkable for his height (as I calculated from the length of his\r\nstride), and the other fashionably dressed, to judge from the small and\r\nelegant impression left by his boots.\r\n\r\n\u201cOn entering the house this last inference was confirmed. My well-booted\r\nman lay before me. The tall one, then, had done the murder, if murder\r\nthere was. There was no wound upon the dead man\u2019s person, but the\r\nagitated expression upon his face assured me that he had foreseen his\r\nfate before it came upon him. Men who die from heart disease, or any\r\nsudden natural cause, never by any chance exhibit agitation upon their\r\nfeatures. Having sniffed the dead man\u2019s lips I detected a slightly sour\r\nsmell, and I came to the conclusion that he had had poison forced upon\r\nhim. Again, I argued that it had been forced upon him from the hatred\r\nand fear expressed upon his face. By the method of exclusion, I had\r\narrived at this result, for no other hypothesis would meet the facts.\r\nDo not imagine that it was a very unheard of idea. The forcible\r\nadministration of poison is by no means a new thing in criminal annals.\r\nThe cases of Dolsky in Odessa, and of Leturier in Montpellier, will\r\noccur at once to any toxicologist.\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd now came the great question as to the'), NULL);
INSERT INTO SYSTEM_LOB_STREAM VALUES(0, 58, STRINGDECODE(' reason why. Robbery had not\r\nbeen the object of the murder, for nothing was taken. Was it politics,\r\nthen, or was it a woman? That was the question which confronted me.\r\nI was inclined from the first to the latter supposition. Political\r\nassassins are only too glad to do their work and to fly. This murder\r\nhad, on the contrary, been done most deliberately, and the perpetrator\r\nhad left his tracks all over the room, showing that he had been there\r\nall the time. It must have been a private wrong, and not a political\r\none, which called for such a methodical revenge. When the inscription\r\nwas discovered upon the wall I was more inclined than ever to my\r\nopinion. The thing was too evidently a blind. When the ring was found,\r\nhowever, it settled the question. Clearly the murderer had used it to\r\nremind his victim of some dead or absent woman. It was at this point\r\nthat I asked Gregson whether he had enquired in his telegram to\r\nCleveland as to any particular point in Mr. Drebber\u2019s former career. He\r\nanswered, you remember, in the negative.\r\n\r\n\u201cI then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room, which\r\nconfirmed me in my opinion as to the murderer\u2019s height, and furnished me\r\nwith the additional details as to the Trichinopoly cigar and the length\r\nof his nails. I had already come to the conclusion, since there were no\r\nsigns of a struggle, that the blood which covered the floor had burst\r\nfrom the murderer\u2019s nose in his excitement. I could perceive that the\r\ntrack of blood coincided with the track of his feet. It is seldom that\r\nany man, unless he is very full-blooded, breaks out in this way through\r\nemotion, so I hazarded the opinion that the criminal was probably a\r\nrobust and ruddy-faced man. Events proved that I had judged correctly.\r\n\r\n\u201cHaving left the house, I proceeded to do what Gregson had neglected. I\r\ntelegraphed to the head of the police at Cleveland, limiting my enquiry\r\nto the circumstances connected with the marriage of Enoch Drebber. The\r\nanswer was conclusive. It told me that Drebber had already applied for\r\nthe protection of the law against an old rival in love, named Jefferson\r\nHope, and that this same Hope was at present in Europe. I knew now that\r\nI held the clue to the mystery in my hand, and all that remained was to\r\nsecure the murderer.\r\n\r\n\u201cI had already determined in my own mind that the man who had walked\r\ninto the house with Drebber, was none other than the man who had driven\r\nthe cab. The marks in the road showed me that the horse had wandered\r\non in a way which would have been impossible had there been anyone in\r\ncharge of it. Where, then, could the driver be, unless he were inside\r\nthe house? Again, it is absurd to suppose that any sane man would carry\r\nout a deliberate crime under the very eyes, as it were, of a third\r\nperson, who was sure to betray him. Lastly, supposing one man wished\r\nto dog another through London, what better means could he adopt than\r\nto turn cabdriver. All these considerations led me to the irresistible\r\nconclusion that Jefferson Hope was to be found among the jarveys of the\r\nMetropolis.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf he had been one there was no reason to believe that he had ceased to\r\nbe. On the contrary, from his point of view, any sudden change would be\r\nlikely to draw attention to himself. He would, probably, for a time at\r\nleast, continue to perform his duties. There was no reason to suppose\r\nthat he was going under an assumed name. Why should he change his name\r\nin a country where no one knew his original one? I therefore organized\r\nmy Street Arab detective corps, and sent them systematically to every\r\ncab proprietor in London until they ferreted out the man that I wanted.\r\nHow well they succeeded, and how quickly I took advantage of it, are\r\nstill fresh in your recollection. The murder of Stangerson was an\r\nincident which was entirely unexpected, but which could hardly in\r\nany case have been prevented.

They consisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large airy sitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad windows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so moderate did the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain was concluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession. That very evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the following morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and portmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and laying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new surroundings. Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet in his ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be up after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and occasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the City. Nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize him, and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night. On these occasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion. As the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his aims in life, gradually deepened and increased. His very person and appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual observer. In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively lean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp and piercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have alluded; and his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air of alertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and squareness which mark the man of determination. His hands were invariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was possessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had occasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments. The reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how much this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured to break through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned himself. Before pronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered, how objectless was my life, and how little there was to engage my attention. My health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather was exceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would call upon me and break the monotony of my daily existence. Under these circumstances, I eagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my companion, and spent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it. He was not studying medicine. He had himself, in reply to a question, confirmed Stamford\u2019s opinion upon that point. Neither did he appear to have pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in science or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance into the learned world. Yet his zeal for certain studies was remarkable, and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have fairly astounded me.

His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporary literature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing. Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired in the naivest way who he might be and what he had done. My surprise reached a climax, however, when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the Copernican Theory and of the composition of the Solar System. That any civilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an extraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it. \u201cYou appear to be astonished,\u201d he said, smiling at my expression of surprise. \u201cNow that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it. \u201d \u201cTo forget it! \u201d \u201cYou see,\u201d he explained, \u201cI consider that a man\u2019s brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones. \u201d \u201cBut the Solar System! \u201d I protested. \u201cWhat the deuce is it to me? \u201d he interrupted impatiently; \u201cyou say that we go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of difference to me or to my work. \u201d I was on the point of asking him what that work might be, but something in his manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one. I pondered over our short conversation, however, and endeavoured to draw my deductions from it. He said that he would acquire no knowledge which did not bear upon his object. Therefore all the knowledge which he possessed was such as would be useful to him. I enumerated in my own mind all the various points upon which he had shown me that he was exceptionally well-informed. I even took a pencil and jotted them down. I could not help smiling at the document when I had completed it. It ran in this way-- SHERLOCK HOLMES--his limits. 1. Knowledge of Literature. --Nil. 2. Philosophy. --Nil. 3. Astronomy. --Nil. 4.

These were very remarkable, but as eccentric as all his other accomplishments.

Leaning back in his arm-chair of an evening, he would close his eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his knee. Sometimes the chords were sonorous and melancholy. Occasionally they were fantastic and cheerful. Clearly they reflected the thoughts which possessed him, but whether the music aided those thoughts, or whether the playing was simply the result of a whim or fancy was more than I could determine. I might have rebelled against these exasperating solos had it not been that he usually terminated them by playing in quick succession a whole series of my favourite airs as a slight compensation for the trial upon my patience. During the first week or so we had no callers, and I had begun to think that my companion was as friendless a man as I was myself. Presently, however, I found that he had many acquaintances, and those in the most different classes of society. There was one little sallow rat-faced, dark-eyed fellow who was introduced to me as Mr. Lestrade, and who came three or four times in a single week. One morning a young girl called, fashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour or more. The same afternoon brought a grey-headed, seedy visitor, looking like a Jew pedlar, who appeared to me to be much excited, and who was closely followed by a slip-shod elderly woman. On another occasion an old white-haired gentleman had an interview with my companion; and on another a railway porter in his velveteen uniform. When any of these nondescript individuals put in an appearance, Sherlock Holmes used to beg for the use of the sitting-room, and I would retire to my bed-room. He always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience. \u201cI have to use this room as a place of business,\u201d he said, \u201cand these people are my clients. \u201d Again I had an opportunity of asking him a point blank question, and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing another man to confide in me. I imagined at the time that he had some strong reason for not alluding to it, but he soon dispelled the idea by coming round to the subject of his own accord. It was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that I rose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes had not yet finished his breakfast. The landlady had become so accustomed to my late habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared. With the unreasonable petulance of mankind I rang the bell and gave a curt intimation that I was ready. Then I picked up a magazine from the table and attempted to while away the time with it, while my companion munched silently at his toast. One of the articles had a pencil mark at the heading, and I naturally began to run my eye through it. Its somewhat ambitious title was \u201cThe Book of Life,\u201d and it attempted to show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic examination of all that came in his way. It struck me as being a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. The reasoning was close and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to be far-fetched and exaggerated. The writer claimed by a momentary expression, a twitch of a muscle or a glance of an eye, to fathom a man\u2019s inmost thoughts. Deceit, according to him, was an impossibility in the case of one trained to observation and analysis. His conclusions were as infallible as so many propositions of Euclid. So startling would his results appear to the uninitiated that until they learned the processes by which he had arrived at them they might well consider him as a necromancer. \u201cFrom a drop of water,\u201d said the writer, \u201ca logician could infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of one or the other. So all life is a great chain, the nature of which is known whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all other arts, the Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired by long and patient study nor is life long enough to allow any mortal to attain the highest possible perfection in it.

Let him, on meeting a fellow-mortal, learn at a glance to distinguish the history of the man, and the trade or profession to which he belongs. Puerile as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens the faculties of observation, and teaches one where to look and what to look for. By a man\u2019s finger nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by his trouser knees, by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by his expression, by his shirt cuffs--by each of these things a man\u2019s calling is plainly revealed. That all united should fail to enlighten the competent enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable. \u201d \u201cWhat ineffable twaddle! \u201d I cried, slapping the magazine down on the table, \u201cI never read such rubbish in my life. \u201d \u201cWhat is it? \u201d asked Sherlock Holmes. \u201cWhy, this article,\u201d I said, pointing at it with my egg spoon as I sat down to my breakfast. \u201cI see that you have read it since you have marked it. I don\u2019t deny that it is smartly written. It irritates me though. It is evidently the theory of some arm-chair lounger who evolves all these neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own study. It is not practical. I should like to see him clapped down in a third class carriage on the Underground, and asked to give the trades of all his fellow-travellers. I would lay a thousand to one against him. \u201d \u201cYou would lose your money,\u201d Sherlock Holmes remarked calmly. \u201cAs for the article I wrote it myself. \u201d \u201cYou! \u201d \u201cYes, I have a turn both for observation and for deduction. The theories which I have expressed there, and which appear to you to be so chimerical are really extremely practical--so practical that I depend upon them for my bread and cheese. \u201d \u201cAnd how? \u201d I asked involuntarily. \u201cWell, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the world. I\u2019m a consulting detective, if you can understand what that is. Here in London we have lots of Government detectives and lots of private ones. When these fellows are at fault they come to me, and I manage to put them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence before me, and I am generally able, by the help of my knowledge of the history of crime, to set them straight. There is a strong family resemblance about misdeeds, and if you have all the details of a thousand at your finger ends, it is odd if you can\u2019t unravel the thousand and first. Lestrade is a well-known detective. He got himself into a fog recently over a forgery case, and that was what brought him here. \u201d \u201cAnd these other people? \u201d \u201cThey are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies. They are all people who are in trouble about something, and want a little enlightening. I listen to their story, they listen to my comments, and then I pocket my fee. \u201d \u201cBut do you mean to say,\u201d I said, \u201cthat without leaving your room you can unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although they have seen every detail for themselves? \u201d \u201cQuite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a case turns up which is a little more complex. Then I have to bustle about and see things with my own eyes. You see I have a lot of special knowledge which I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters wonderfully. Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused your scorn, are invaluable to me in practical work. Observation with me is second nature. You appeared to be surprised when I told you, on our first meeting, that you had come from Afghanistan. \u201d \u201cYou were told, no doubt. \u201d \u201cNothing of the sort. I _knew_ you came from Afghanistan. From long habit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind, that I arrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate steps. There were such steps, however. The train of reasoning ran, \u2018Here is a gentleman of a medical type, but with the air of a military man. Clearly an army doctor, then.

I then remarked that you came from Afghanistan, and you were astonished. \u201d \u201cIt is simple enough as you explain it,\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cYou remind me of Edgar Allen Poe\u2019s Dupin. I had no idea that such individuals did exist outside of stories. \u201d Sherlock Holmes rose and lit his pipe. \u201cNo doubt you think that you are complimenting me in comparing me to Dupin,\u201d he observed. \u201cNow, in my opinion, Dupin was a very inferior fellow. That trick of his of breaking in on his friends\u2019 thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter of an hour\u2019s silence is really very showy and superficial. He had some analytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such a phenomenon as Poe appeared to imagine. \u201d \u201cHave you read Gaboriau\u2019s works? \u201d I asked. \u201cDoes Lecoq come up to your idea of a detective? \u201d Sherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically. \u201cLecoq was a miserable bungler,\u201d he said, in an angry voice; \u201che had only one thing to recommend him, and that was his energy. That book made me positively ill. The question was how to identify an unknown prisoner. I could have done it in twenty-four hours. Lecoq took six months or so. It might be made a text-book for detectives to teach them what to avoid. \u201d I felt rather indignant at having two characters whom I had admired treated in this cavalier style. I walked over to the window, and stood looking out into the busy street. \u201cThis fellow may be very clever,\u201d I said to myself, \u201cbut he is certainly very conceited. \u201d \u201cThere are no crimes and no criminals in these days,\u201d he said, querulously. \u201cWhat is the use of having brains in our profession. I know well that I have it in me to make my name famous. No man lives or has ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural talent to the detection of crime which I have done. And what is the result? There is no crime to detect, or, at most, some bungling villainy with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard official can see through it. \u201d I was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation. I thought it best to change the topic. \u201cI wonder what that fellow is looking for? \u201d I asked, pointing to a stalwart, plainly-dressed individual who was walking slowly down the other side of the street, looking anxiously at the numbers. He had a large blue envelope in his hand, and was evidently the bearer of a message. \u201cYou mean the retired sergeant of Marines,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes. \u201cBrag and bounce! \u201d thought I to myself. \u201cHe knows that I cannot verify his guess. \u201d The thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were watching caught sight of the number on our door, and ran rapidly across the roadway. We heard a loud knock, a deep voice below, and heavy steps ascending the stair. \u201cFor Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\u201d he said, stepping into the room and handing my friend the letter. Here was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him. He little thought of this when he made that random shot. \u201cMay I ask, my lad,\u201d I said, in the blandest voice, \u201cwhat your trade may be? \u201d \u201cCommissionaire, sir,\u201d he said, gruffly. \u201cUniform away for repairs. \u201d \u201cAnd you were? \u201d I asked, with a slightly malicious glance at my companion. \u201cA sergeant, sir, Royal Marine Light Infantry, sir.

SHERLOCK HOLMES,-- \u201cThere has been a bad business during the night at 3, Lauriston Gardens, off the Brixton Road. Our man on the beat saw a light there about two in the morning, and as the house was an empty one, suspected that something was amiss. He found the door open, and in the front room, which is bare of furniture, discovered the body of a gentleman, well dressed, and having cards in his pocket bearing the name of \u2018Enoch J. Drebber, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.A.\u2019 There had been no robbery, nor is there any evidence as to how the man met his death. There are marks of blood in the room, but there is no wound upon his person. We are at a loss as to how he came into the empty house; indeed, the whole affair is a puzzler. If you can come round to the house any time before twelve, you will find me there. I have left everything _in statu quo_ until I hear from you. If you are unable to come I shall give you fuller details, and would esteem it a great kindness if you would favour me with your opinion. Yours faithfully, \u201cTOBIAS GREGSON. \u201d \u201cGregson is the smartest of the Scotland Yarders,\u201d my friend remarked; \u201che and Lestrade are the pick of a bad lot. They are both quick and energetic, but conventional--shockingly so. They have their knives into one another, too. They are as jealous as a pair of professional beauties. There will be some fun over this case if they are both put upon the scent. \u201d I was amazed at the calm way in which he rippled on. \u201cSurely there is not a moment to be lost,\u201d I cried, \u201cshall I go and order you a cab? \u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure about whether I shall go.

It was a foggy, cloudy morning, and a dun-coloured veil hung over the house-tops, looking like the reflection of the mud-coloured streets beneath. My companion was in the best of spirits, and prattled away about Cremona fiddles, and the difference between a Stradivarius and an Amati. As for myself, I was silent, for the dull weather and the melancholy business upon which we were engaged, depressed my spirits. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem to give much thought to the matter in hand,\u201d I said at last, interrupting Holmes\u2019 musical disquisition. \u201cNo data yet,\u201d he answered. \u201cIt is a capital mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence. It biases the judgment. \u201d \u201cYou will have your data soon,\u201d I remarked, pointing with my finger; \u201cthis is the Brixton Road, and that is the house, if I am not very much mistaken. \u201d \u201cSo it is. Stop, driver, stop! \u201d We were still a hundred yards or so from it, but he insisted upon our alighting, and we finished our journey upon foot. Number 3, Lauriston Gardens wore an ill-omened and minatory look. It was one of four which stood back some little way from the street, two being occupied and two empty. The latter looked out with three tiers of vacant melancholy windows, which were blank and dreary, save that here and there a \u201cTo Let\u201d card had developed like a cataract upon the bleared panes. A small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption of sickly plants separated each of these houses from the street, and was traversed by a narrow pathway, yellowish in colour, and consisting apparently of a mixture of clay and of gravel. The whole place was very sloppy from the rain which had fallen through the night. The garden was bounded by a three-foot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the top, and against this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable, surrounded by a small knot of loafers, who craned their necks and strained their eyes in the vain hope of catching some glimpse of the proceedings within. I had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the house and plunged into a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared to be further from his intention. With an air of nonchalance which, under the circumstances, seemed to me to border upon affectation, he lounged up and down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, the opposite houses and the line of railings. Having finished his scrutiny, he proceeded slowly down the path, or rather down the fringe of grass which flanked the path, keeping his eyes riveted upon the ground. Twice he stopped, and once I saw him smile, and heard him utter an exclamation of satisfaction. There were many marks of footsteps upon the wet clayey soil, but since the police had been coming and going over it, I was unable to see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it. Still I had had such extraordinary evidence of the quickness of his perceptive faculties, that I had no doubt that he could see a great deal which was hidden from me. At the door of the house we were met by a tall, white-faced, flaxen-haired man, with a notebook in his hand, who rushed forward and wrung my companion\u2019s hand with effusion. \u201cIt is indeed kind of you to come,\u201d he said, \u201cI have had everything left untouched. \u201d \u201cExcept that! \u201d my friend answered, pointing at the pathway. \u201cIf a herd of buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess. No doubt, however, you had drawn your own conclusions, Gregson, before you permitted this. \u201d \u201cI have had so much to do inside the house,\u201d the detective said evasively. \u201cMy colleague, Mr. Lestrade, is here.

A short passage, bare planked and dusty, led to the kitchen and offices. Two doors opened out of it to the left and to the right. One of these had obviously been closed for many weeks. The other belonged to the dining-room, which was the apartment in which the mysterious affair had occurred. Holmes walked in, and I followed him with that subdued feeling at my heart which the presence of death inspires. It was a large square room, looking all the larger from the absence of all furniture. A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it was blotched in places with mildew, and here and there great strips had become detached and hung down, exposing the yellow plaster beneath. Opposite the door was a showy fireplace, surmounted by a mantelpiece of imitation white marble. On one corner of this was stuck the stump of a red wax candle. The solitary window was so dirty that the light was hazy and uncertain, giving a dull grey tinge to everything, which was intensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole apartment. All these details I observed afterwards. At present my attention was centred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon the boards, with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured ceiling. It was that of a man about forty-three or forty-four years of age, middle-sized, broad shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and a short stubbly beard. He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat and waistcoat, with light-coloured trousers, and immaculate collar and cuffs. A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floor beside him. His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while his lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been a grievous one. On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror, and as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human features. This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low forehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a singularly simious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his writhing, unnatural posture. I have seen death in many forms, but never has it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy apartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban London. Lestrade, lean and ferret-like as ever, was standing by the doorway, and greeted my companion and myself. \u201cThis case will make a stir, sir,\u201d he remarked. \u201cIt beats anything I have seen, and I am no chicken. \u201d \u201cThere is no clue? \u201d said Gregson. \u201cNone at all,\u201d chimed in Lestrade. Sherlock Holmes approached the body, and, kneeling down, examined it intently. \u201cYou are sure that there is no wound? \u201d he asked, pointing to numerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round. \u201cPositive! \u201d cried both detectives. \u201cThen, of course, this blood belongs to a second individual--[8] presumably the murderer, if murder has been committed. It reminds me of the circumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen, in Utrecht, in the year \u201834. Do you remember the case, Gregson? \u201d \u201cNo, sir. \u201d \u201cRead it up--you really should. There is nothing new under the sun. It has all been done before. \u201d As he spoke, his nimble fingers were flying here, there, and everywhere, feeling, pressing, unbuttoning, examining, while his eyes wore the same far-away expression which I have already remarked upon. So swiftly was the examination made, that one would hardly have guessed the minuteness with which it was conducted. Finally, he sniffed the dead man\u2019s lips, and then glanced a'), NULL);

At his call they entered the room, and the stranger was lifted and carried out. As they raised him, a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor. Lestrade grabbed it up and stared at it with mystified eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s been a woman here,\u201d he cried. \u201cIt\u2019s a woman\u2019s wedding-ring. \u201d He held it out, as he spoke, upon the palm of his hand. We all gathered round him and gazed at it. There could be no doubt that that circlet of plain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride. \u201cThis complicates matters,\u201d said Gregson. \u201cHeaven knows, they were complicated enough before. \u201d \u201cYou\u2019re sure it doesn\u2019t simplify them? \u201d observed Holmes. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be learned by staring at it. What did you find in his pockets? \u201d \u201cWe have it all here,\u201d said Gregson, pointing to a litter of objects upon one of the bottom steps of the stairs. \u201cA gold watch, No. 97163, by Barraud, of London. Gold Albert chain, very heavy and solid. Gold ring, with masonic device. Gold pin--bull-dog\u2019s head, with rubies as eyes. Russian leather card-case, with cards of Enoch J. Drebber of Cleveland, corresponding with the E. J. D. upon the linen. No purse, but loose money to the extent of seven pounds thirteen. Pocket edition of Boccaccio\u2019s \u2018Decameron,\u2019 with name of Joseph Stangerson upon the fly-leaf. Two letters--one addressed to E. J. Drebber and one to Joseph Stangerson. \u201d \u201cAt what address? \u201d \u201cAmerican Exchange, Strand--to be left till called for. They are both from the Guion Steamship Company, and refer to the sailing of their boats from Liverpool. It is clear that this unfortunate man was about to return to New York. \u201d \u201cHave you made any inquiries as to this man, Stangerson? \u201d \u201cI did it at once, sir,\u201d said Gregson. \u201cI have had advertisements sent to all the newspapers, and one of my men has gone to the American Exchange, but he has not returned yet. \u201d \u201cHave you sent to Cleveland? \u201d \u201cWe telegraphed this morning. \u201d \u201cHow did you word your inquiries? \u201d \u201cWe simply detailed the circumstances, and said that we should be glad of any information which could help us. \u201d \u201cYou did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to be crucial? \u201d \u201cI asked about Stangerson. \u201d \u201cNothing else? Is there no circumstance on which this whole case appears to hinge? Will you not telegraph again? \u201d \u201cI have said all I have to say,\u201d said Gregson, in an offended voice. Sherlock Holmes chuckled to himself, and appeared to be about to make some remark, when Lestrade, who had been in the front room while we were holding this conversation in the hall, reappeared upon the scene, rubbing his hands in a pompous and self-satisfied manner. \u201cMr. Gregson,\u201d he said, \u201cI have just made a discovery of the highest importance, and one which would have been overlooked had I not made a careful examination of the walls. \u201d The little man\u2019s eyes sparkled as he spoke, and he was evidently in a state of suppressed exultation at having scored a point against his colleague. \u201cCome here,\u201d he said, bustling back into the room, the atmosphere of which felt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate. \u201cNow, stand there! \u201d He struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall. \u201cLook at that! \u201d he said, triumphantly. I have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts. In this particular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off, leaving a yellow square of coarse plastering. Across this bare space there was scrawled in blood-red letters a single word-- RACHE. \u201cWhat do you think of that? \u201d cried the detective, with the air of a showman exhibiting his show. \u201cThis was overlooked because it was in the darkest corner of the room, and no one thought of looking there. The murderer has written it with his or her own blood. See this smear where it has trickled down the wall! That disposes of the idea of suicide anyhow'), NULL);

It was lit at the time, and if it was lit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion of the wall. \u201d \u201cAnd what does it mean now that you _have_ found it? \u201d asked Gregson in a depreciatory voice. \u201cMean? Why, it means that the writer was going to put the female name Rachel, but was disturbed before he or she had time to finish. You mark my words, when this case comes to be cleared up you will find that a woman named Rachel has something to do with it. It\u2019s all very well for you to laugh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. You may be very smart and clever, but the old hound is the best, when all is said and done. \u201d \u201cI really beg your pardon! \u201d said my companion, who had ruffled the little man\u2019s temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter. \u201cYou certainly have the credit of being the first of us to find this out, and, as you say, it bears every mark of having been written by the other participant in last night\u2019s mystery. I have not had time to examine this room yet, but with your permission I shall do so now. \u201d As he spoke, he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying glass from his pocket. With these two implements he trotted noiselessly about the room, sometimes stopping, occasionally kneeling, and once lying flat upon his face. So engrossed was he with his occupation that he appeared to have forgotten our presence, for he chattered away to himself under his breath the whole time, keeping up a running fire of exclamations, groans, whistles, and little cries suggestive of encouragement and of hope. As I watched him I was irresistibly reminded of a pure-blooded well-trained foxhound as it dashes backwards and forwards through the covert, whining in its eagerness, until it comes across the lost scent. For twenty minutes or more he continued his researches, measuring with the most exact care the distance between marks which were entirely invisible to me, and occasionally applying his tape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible manner. In one place he gathered up very carefully a little pile of grey dust from the floor, and packed it away in an envelope. Finally, he examined with his glass the word upon the wall, going over every letter of it with the most minute exactness. This done, he appeared to be satisfied, for he replaced his tape and his glass in his pocket. \u201cThey say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains,\u201d he remarked with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s a very bad definition, but it does apply to detective work. \u201d Gregson and Lestrade had watched the manoeuvres [9] of their amateur companion with considerable curiosity and some contempt. They evidently failed to appreciate the fact, which I had begun to realize, that Sherlock Holmes\u2019 smallest actions were all directed towards some definite and practical end. \u201cWhat do you think of it, sir? \u201d they both asked. \u201cIt would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to presume to help you,\u201d remarked my friend. \u201cYou are doing so well now that it would be a pity for anyone to interfere. \u201d There was a world of sarcasm in his voice as he spoke. \u201cIf you will let me know how your investigations go,\u201d he continued, \u201cI shall be happy to give you any help I can. In the meantime I should like to speak to the constable who found the body. Can you give me his name and address? \u201d Lestrade glanced at his note-book. \u201cJohn Rance,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is off duty now. You will find him at 46, Audley Court, Kennington Park Gate. \u201d Holmes took a note of the address. \u201cCome along, Doctor,\u201d he said; \u201cwe shall go and look him up. I\u2019ll tell you one thing which may help you in the case,\u201d he continued, turning to the two detectives. \u201cThere has been murder done, and the murderer was a man. He was more than six feet high, was in the prime of life, had small feet for his height, wore coarse, square-toed boots and smoked a Trichinopoly cigar. He came here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab, which was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his off fore leg. In all '), NULL);

Sherlock Holmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a long telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take us to the address given us by Lestrade. \u201cThere is nothing like first hand evidence,\u201d he remarked; \u201cas a matter of fact, my mind is entirely made up upon the case, but still we may as well learn all that is to be learned. \u201d \u201cYou amaze me, Holmes,\u201d said I. \u201cSurely you are not as sure as you pretend to be of all those particulars which you gave. \u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no room for a mistake,\u201d he answered. \u201cThe very first thing which I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts with its wheels close to the curb. Now, up to last night, we have had no rain for a week, so that those wheels which left such a deep impression must have been there during the night. There were the marks of the horse\u2019s hoofs, too, the outline of one of which was far more clearly cut than that of the other three, showing that that was a new shoe. Since the cab was there after the rain began, and was not there at any time during the morning--I have Gregson\u2019s word for that--it follows that it must have been there during the night, and, therefore, that it brought those two individuals to the house. \u201d \u201cThat seems simple enough,\u201d said I; \u201cbut how about the other man\u2019s height? \u201d \u201cWhy, the height of a man, in nine cases out of ten, can be told from the length of his stride. It is a simple calculation enough, though there is no use my boring you with figures. I had this fellow\u2019s stride both on the clay outside and on the dust within. Then I had a way of checking my calculation. When a man writes on a wall, his instinct leads him to write about the level of his own eyes. Now that writing was just over six feet from the ground. It was child\u2019s play. \u201d \u201cAnd his age? \u201d I asked. \u201cWell, if a man can stride four and a-half feet without the smallest effort, he can\u2019t be quite in the sere and yellow. That was the breadth of a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across. Patent-leather boots had gone round, and Square-toes had hopped over. There is no mystery about it at all. I am simply applying to ordinary life a few of those precepts of observation and deduction which I advocated in that article. Is there anything else that puzzles you? \u201d \u201cThe finger nails and the Trichinopoly,\u201d I suggested. \u201cThe writing on the wall was done with a man\u2019s forefinger dipped in blood. My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly scratched in doing it, which would not have been the case if the man\u2019s nail had been trimmed. I gathered up some scattered ash from the floor. It was dark in colour and flakey--such an ash as is only made by a Trichinopoly. I have made a special study of cigar ashes--in fact, I have written a monograph upon the subject. I flatter myself that I can distinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand, either of cigar or of tobacco. It is just in such details that the skilled detective differs from the Gregson and Lestrade type. \u201d \u201cAnd the florid face? \u201d I asked. \u201cAh, that was a more daring shot, though I have no doubt that I was right. You must not ask me that at the present state of the affair. \u201d I passed my hand over my brow. \u201cMy head is in a whirl,\u201d I remarked; \u201cthe more one thinks of it the more'), NULL);

How could one man compel another to take poison? Where did the blood come from? What was the object of the murderer, since robbery had no part in it? How came the woman\u2019s ring there? Above all, why should the second man write up the German word RACHE before decamping? I confess that I cannot see any possible way of reconciling all these facts. \u201d My companion smiled approvingly. \u201cYou sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is much that is still obscure, though I have quite made up my mind on the main facts. As to poor Lestrade\u2019s discovery it was simply a blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track, by suggesting Socialism and secret societies. It was not done by a German. The A, if you noticed, was printed somewhat after the German fashion. Now, a real German invariably prints in the Latin character, so that we may safely say that this was not written by one, but by a clumsy imitator who overdid his part. It was simply a ruse to divert inquiry into a wrong channel. I\u2019m not going to tell you much more of the case, Doctor. You know a conjuror gets no credit when once he has explained his trick, and if I show you too much of my method of working, you will come to the conclusion that I am a very ordinary individual after all. \u201d \u201cI shall never do that,\u201d I answered; \u201cyou have brought detection as near an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world. \u201d My companion flushed up with pleasure at my words, and the earnest way in which I uttered them. I had already observed that he was as sensitive to flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of her beauty. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you one other thing,\u201d he said. \u201cPatent leathers [10] and Square-toes came in the same cab, and they walked down the pathway together as friendly as possible--arm-in-arm, in all probability. When they got inside they walked up and down the room--or rather, Patent-leathers stood still while Square-toes walked up and down. I could read all that in the dust; and I could read that as he walked he grew more and more excited. That is shown by the increased length of his strides. He was talking all the while, and working himself up, no doubt, into a fury. Then the tragedy occurred. I\u2019ve told you all I know myself now, for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture. We have a good working basis, however, on which to start. We must hurry up, for I want to go to Halle\u2019s concert to hear Norman Neruda this afternoon. \u201d This conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way through a long succession of dingy streets and dreary by-ways. In the dingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand. \u201cThat\u2019s Audley Court in there,\u201d he said, pointing to a narrow slit in the line of dead-coloured brick. \u201cYou\u2019ll find me here when you come back. \u201d Audley Court was not an attractive locality. The narrow passage led us into a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings. We picked our way among groups of dirty children, and through lines of discoloured linen, until we came to Number 46, the door of which was decorated with a small slip of brass on which the name Rance was engraved. On enquiry we found that the constable was in bed, and we were shown into a little front parlour to await his coming. He appeared presently, looking a little irritable at being disturbed in his slumbers. \u201cI made my report at the office,\u201d he said. Holmes took a half-sovereign from his pocket and played with it pensively. \u201cWe thought that we should like to hear it all from your own lips,\u201d he said. \u201cI shall be most happy to tell you anything I can,\u201d the constable answered with his eyes upon the little golden disk. \u201cJust let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred. \u201d Rance sat down on the horsehair sofa, and knitted his brows as though determined not to omit anything in his narrative. \u201cI\u2019ll tell it ye from the beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cMy time is from ten at night to six in the'), NULL);

At one o\u2019clock it began to rain, and I met Harry Murcher--him who has the Holland Grove beat--and we stood together at the corner of Henrietta Street a-talkin\u2019. Presently--maybe about two or a little after--I thought I would take a look round and see that all was right down the Brixton Road. It was precious dirty and lonely. Not a soul did I meet all the way down, though a cab or two went past me. I was a strollin\u2019 down, thinkin\u2019 between ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be, when suddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of that same house. Now, I knew that them two houses in Lauriston Gardens was empty on account of him that owns them who won\u2019t have the drains seen to, though the very last tenant what lived in one of them died o\u2019 typhoid fever. I was knocked all in a heap therefore at seeing a light in the window, and I suspected as something was wrong.

Ye see, when I got up to the door it was so still and so lonesome, that I thought I\u2019d be none the worse for some one with me. I ain\u2019t afeared of anything on this side o\u2019 the grave; but I thought that maybe it was him that died o\u2019 the typhoid inspecting the drains what killed him. The thought gave me a kind o\u2019 turn, and I walked back to the gate to see if I could see Murcher\u2019s lantern, but there wasn\u2019t no sign of him nor of anyone else. \u201d \u201cThere was no one in the street? \u201d \u201cNot a livin\u2019 soul, sir, nor as much as a dog. Then I pulled myself together and went back and pushed the door open. All was quiet inside, so I went into the room where the light was a-burnin\u2019. There was a candle flickerin\u2019 on the mantelpiece--a red wax one--and by its light I saw----\u201d \u201cYes, I know all that you saw. You walked round the room several times, and you knelt down by the body, and then you walked through and tried the kitchen door, and then----\u201d John Rance sprang to his feet with a frightened face and suspicion in his eyes. \u201cWhere was you hid to see all that? \u201d he cried. \u201cIt seems to me that you knows a deal more than you should. \u201d Holmes laughed and threw his card across the table to the constable. \u201cDon\u2019t get arresting me for the murder,\u201d he said. \u201cI am one of the hounds and not the wolf; Mr. Gregson or Mr. Lestrade will answer for that. Go on, though. What did you do next? \u201d Rance resumed his seat, without however losing his mystified expression. \u201cI went back to the gate and sounded my whistle. That brought Murcher and two more to the spot. \u201d \u201cWas the street empty then? \u201d \u201cWell, it was, as far as anybody that could be of any good goes. \u201d \u201cWhat do you mean? \u201d The constable\u2019s features broadened into a grin. \u201cI\u2019ve seen many a drunk chap in my time,\u201d he said, \u201cbut never anyone so cryin\u2019 drunk as that cove.

He couldn\u2019t stand, far less help. \u201d \u201cWhat sort of a man was he? \u201d asked Sherlock Holmes.

After Holmes\u2019 departure for the concert, I lay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours\u2019 sleep. It was a useless attempt. My mind had been too much excited by all that had occurred, and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into it. Every time that I closed my eyes I saw before me the distorted baboon-like countenance of the murdered man. So sinister was the impression which that face had produced upon me that I found it difficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who had removed its owner from the world. If ever human features bespoke vice of the most malignant type, they were certainly those of Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland. Still I recognized that justice must be done, and that the depravity of the victim was no condonment [11] in the eyes of the law. The more I thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion\u2019s hypothesis, that the man had been poisoned, appear. I remembered how he had sniffed his lips, and had no doubt that he had detected something which had given rise to the idea. Then, again, if not poison, what had caused the man\u2019s death, since there was neither wound nor marks of strangulation? But, on the other hand, whose blood was that which lay so thickly upon the floor? There were no signs of a struggle, nor had the victim any weapon with which he might have wounded an antagonist. As long as all these questions were unsolved, I felt that sleep would be no easy matter, either for Holmes or myself. His quiet self-confident manner convinced me that he had already formed a theory which explained all the facts, though what it was I could not for an instant conjecture. He was very late in returning--so late, that I knew that the concert could not have detained him all the time. Dinner was on the table before he appeared. \u201cIt was magnificent,\u201d he said, as he took his seat. \u201cDo you remember what Darwi'), NULL);

He claims that the power of producing and appreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of speech was arrived at. Perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced by it. There are vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries when the world was in its childhood. \u201d \u201cThat\u2019s rather a broad idea,\u201d I remarked. \u201cOne\u2019s ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret Nature,\u201d he answered. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You\u2019re not looking quite yourself. This Brixton Road affair has upset you. \u201d \u201cTo tell the truth, it has,\u201d I said. \u201cI ought to be more case-hardened after my Afghan experiences. I saw my own comrades hacked to pieces at Maiwand without losing my nerve. \u201d \u201cI can understand. There is a mystery about this which stimulates the imagination; where there is no imagination there is no horror. Have you seen the evening paper? \u201d \u201cNo. \u201d \u201cIt gives a fairly good account of the affair. It does not mention the fact that when the man was raised up, a woman\u2019s wedding ring fell upon the floor. It is just as well it does not. \u201d \u201cWhy? \u201d \u201cLook at this advertisement,\u201d he answered. \u201cI had one sent to every paper this morning immediately after the affair. \u201d He threw the paper across to me and I glanced at the place indicated. It was the first announcement in the \u201cFound\u201d column. \u201cIn Brixton Road, this morning,\u201d it ran, \u201ca plain gold wedding ring, found in the roadway between the \u2018White Hart\u2019 Tavern and Holland Grove. Apply Dr. Watson, 221B, Baker Street, between eight and nine this evening. \u201d \u201cExcuse my using your name,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I used my own some of these dunderheads would recognize it, and want to meddle in the affair. \u201d \u201cThat is all right,\u201d I answered. \u201cBut supposing anyone applies, I have no ring. \u201d \u201cOh yes, you have,\u201d said he, handing me one. \u201cThis will do very well. It is almost a facsimile. \u201d \u201cAnd who do you expect will answer this advertisement. \u201d \u201cWhy, the man in the brown coat--our florid friend with the square toes. If he does not come himself he will send an accomplice. \u201d \u201cWould he not consider it as too dangerous? \u201d \u201cNot at all. If my view of the case is correct, and I have every reason to believe that it is, this man would rather risk anything than lose the ring. According to my notion he dropped it while stooping over Drebber\u2019s body, and did not miss it at the time. After leaving the house he discovered his loss and hurried back, but found the police already in possession, owing to his own folly in leaving the candle burning. He had to pretend to be drunk in order to allay the suspicions which might have been aroused by his appearance at the gate. Now put yourself in that man\u2019s place. On thinking the matter over, it must have occurred to him that it was possible that he had lost the ring in the road after leaving the house. What would he do, then? He would eagerly look out for the evening papers in the hope of seeing it among the articles found. His eye, of course, would light upon this. He would be overjoyed. Why should he fear a trap? There would be no reason in his eyes why the finding of the ring should be connected with the murder. He would come. He will come. You shall see him within an hour? \u201d \u201cAnd then? \u201d I asked. \u201cOh, you can leave me to deal with him then. Have you any arms? \u201d \u201cI have my old service revolver and a few cartridges. \u201d \u201cYou had better clean it and load it. He will be a desperate man, and though I shall take him unawares, it is as well to be ready for anything. \u201d I went to my bedroom and followed his advice. When I returned with the pistol the table had been cleared, and Holmes was engaged in his favourite occupation of scraping upon his violin. \u201cThe plot thickens,\u201d he said, as I entered; \u201cI have just had an answer to my American telegram. My view of the case is the correct one. \u201d \u201cAnd that is? \u201d I asked eagerly. \u201cMy fiddle would be the better for new strings,\u201d he remarked. \u201cPut your pistol in your pocket.

On the fly-leaf, in very faded ink, is written \u2018Ex libris Guliolmi Whyte. \u2019 I wonder who William Whyte was. Some pragmatical seventeenth century lawyer, I suppose. His writing has a legal twist about it. Here comes our man, I think. \u201d As he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell. Sherlock Holmes rose softly and moved his chair in the direction of the door. We heard the servant pass along the hall, and the sharp click of the latch as she opened it. \u201cDoes Dr. Watson live here? \u201d asked a clear but rather harsh voice. We could not hear the servant\u2019s reply, but the door closed, and some one began to ascend the stairs. The footfall was an uncertain and shuffling one. A look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as he listened to it. It came slowly along the passage, and there was a feeble tap at the door. \u201cCome in,\u201d I cried. At my summons, instead of the man of violence whom we expected, a very old and wrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment. She appeared to be dazzled by the sudden blaze of light, and after dropping a curtsey, she stood blinking at us with her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocket with nervous, shaky fingers. I glanced at my companion, and his face had assumed such a disconsolate expression that it was all I could do to keep my countenance. The old crone drew out an evening paper, and pointed at our advertisement. \u201cIt\u2019s this as has brought me, good gentlemen,\u201d she said, dropping another curtsey; \u201ca gold wedding ring in the Brixton Road. It belongs to my girl Sally, as was married only this time twelvemonth, which her husband is steward aboard a Union boat, and what he\u2019d say if he come \u2018ome and found her without her ring is more than I can think, he being short enough at the best o\u2019 times, but more especially when he has the drink. If it please you, she went to the circus last night along with----\u201d \u201cIs that her ring? \u201d I asked. \u201cThe Lord be thanked! \u201d cried the old woman; \u201cSally will be a glad woman this night. That\u2019s the ring. \u201d \u201cAnd what may your address be? \u201d I inquired, taking up a pencil. \u201c13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch. A weary way from here. \u201d \u201cThe Brixton Road does not lie between any circus and Houndsditch,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes sharply. The old woman faced round and looked keenly at him from her little red-rimmed eyes. \u201cThe gentleman asked me for _my_ address,\u201d she said. \u201cSally lives in lodgings at 3, Mayfield Place, Peckham. \u201d \u201cAnd your name is----? \u201d \u201cMy name is Sawyer--her\u2019s is Dennis, which Tom Dennis married her--and a smart, clean lad, too, as long as he\u2019s at sea, and no steward in the company more thought of; but when on shore, what with the women and what with liquor shops----\u201d \u201cHere is your ring, Mrs. Sawyer,\u201d I interrupted, in obedience to a sign from my companion; \u201cit clearly belongs to your daughter, and I am glad to be able to restore it to the rightful owner. \u201d With many mumbled blessings and protestations of gratitude the old crone packed it away in her pocket, and shuffled off down the stairs. Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet the moment that she was gone and rushed into his room. He returned in a few seconds enveloped in an ulster and a cravat. \u201cI\u2019ll follow her,\u201d he said, hurriedly; \u201cshe must be an accomplice, and will lead me to him. Wait up for me. \u201d The hall door had hardly slammed behind our visitor before Holmes had descended the stair. Looking through the window I could see her walking feebly along the other side, while her pursuer dogged her some little distance behind. \u201cEither his whole theory is incorrect,\u201d I thought to myself, \u201cor else he will be led now to the heart of the mystery. \u201d There was n'), NULL);

Eleven, and the more stately tread of the landlady passed my door, bound for the same destination. It was close upon twelve before I heard the sharp sound of his latch-key. The instant he entered I saw by his face that he had not been successful. Amusement and chagrin seemed to be struggling for the mastery, until the former suddenly carried the day, and he burst into a hearty laugh. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have the Scotland Yarders know it for the world,\u201d he cried, dropping into his chair; \u201cI have chaffed them so much that they would never have let me hear the end of it.

That creature had gone a little way when she began to limp and show every sign of being foot-sore. Presently she came to a halt, and hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. I managed to be close to her so as to hear the address, but I need not have been so anxious, for she sang it out loud enough to be heard at the other side of the street, \u2018Drive to 13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch,\u2019 she cried. This begins to look genuine, I thought, and having seen her safely inside, I perched myself behind. That\u2019s an art which every detective should be an expert at. Well, away we rattled, and never drew rein until we reached the street in question. I hopped off before we came to the door, and strolled down the street in an easy, lounging way. I saw the cab pull up. The driver jumped down, and I saw him open the door and stand expectantly. Nothing came out though. When I reached him he was groping about frantically in the empty cab, and giving vent to the finest assorted collection of oaths that ever I listened to. There was no sign or trace of his passenger, and I fear it will be some time before he gets his fare. On inquiring at Number 13 we found that the house belonged to a respectable paperhanger, named Keswick, and that no one of the name either of Sawyer or Dennis had ever been heard of there. \u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t mean to say,\u201d I cried, in amazement, \u201cthat that tottering, feeble old woman was able to get out of the cab while it was in motion, without either you or the driver seeing her? \u201d \u201cOld woman be damned! \u201d said Sherlock Holmes, sharply. \u201cWe were the old women to be so taken in.

The Socialists had many branches in America, and the deceased had, no doubt, infringed their unwritten laws, and been tracked down by them. After alluding airily to the Vehmgericht, aqua tofana, Carbonari, the Marchioness de Brinvilliers, the Darwinian theory, the principles of Malthus, and the Ratcliff Highway murders, the article concluded by admonishing the Government and advocating a closer watch over foreigners in England. The _Standard_ commented upon the fact that lawless outrages of the sort usually occurred under a Liberal Administration. They arose from the unsettling of the minds of the masses, and the consequent weakening of all authority. The deceased was an American gentleman who had been residing for some weeks in the Metropolis. He had stayed at the boarding-house of Madame Charpentier, in Torquay Terrace, Camberwell. He was accompanied in his travels by his private secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson. The two bade adieu to their landlady upon Tuesday, the 4th inst., and departed to Euston Station with the avowed intention of catching the Liverpool express. They were afterwards seen together upon the platform. Nothing more is known of them until Mr. Drebber\u2019s body was, as recorded, discovered in an empty house in the Brixton Road, many miles from Euston. How he came there, or how he met his fate, are questions which are still involved in mystery. Nothing is known of the whereabouts of Stangerson. We are glad to learn that Mr. Lestrade and Mr. Gregson, of Scotland Yard, are both engaged upon the case, and it is confidently anticipated that these well-known officers will speedily throw light upon the matter. The _Daily News_ observed that there was no doubt as to the crime being a political one. The despotism and hatred of Liberalism which animated the Continental Governments had had the effect of driving to our shores a number of men who might have made excellent citizens were they not soured by the recollection of all that they had undergone. Among these men there was a stringent code of honour, any infringement of which was punished by death. Every effort should be made to find the secretary, Stangerson, and to ascertain some particulars of the habits of the deceased. A great step had been gained by the discovery of the address of the house at which he had boarded--a result which was entirely due to the acuteness and energy of Mr. Gregson of Scotland Yard. Sherlock Holmes and I read these notices over together at breakfast, and they appeared to afford him considerable amusement. \u201cI told you that, whatever happened, Lestrade and Gregson would be sure to score. \u201d \u201cThat depends on how it turns out. \u201d \u201cOh, bless you, it doesn\u2019t matter in the least.

They are as sharp as needles, too; all they want is organisation. \u201d \u201cIs it on this Brixton case that you are employing them? \u201d I asked. \u201cYes; there is a point which I wish to ascertain.

Bound for us, I know. Yes, he is stopping. There he is! \u201d There was a violent peal at the bell, and in a few seconds the fair-haired detective came up the stairs, three steps at a time, and burst into our sitting-room. \u201cMy dear fellow,\u201d he cried, wringing Holmes\u2019 unresponsive hand, \u201ccongratulate me! I have made the whole thing as clear as day. \u201d A shade of anxiety seemed to me to cross my companion\u2019s expressive face. \u201cDo you mean that you are on the right track? \u201d he asked. \u201cThe right track! Why, sir, we have the man under lock and key. \u201d \u201cAnd his name is? \u201d \u201cArthur Charpentier, sub-lieutenant in Her Majesty\u2019s navy,\u201d cried Gregson, pompously, rubbing his fat hands and inflating his chest. Sherlock Holmes gave a sigh of relief, and relaxed into a smile. \u201cTake a seat, and try one of these cigars,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are anxious to know how you managed it. Will you have some whiskey and water? \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t mind if I do,\u201d the detective answered. \u201cThe tremendous exertions which I have gone through during the last day or two have worn me out. Not so much bodily exertion, you understand, as the strain upon the mind. You will appreciate that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for we are both brain-workers. \u201d \u201cYou do me too much honour,\u201d said Holmes, gravely. \u201cLet us hear how you arrived at this most gratifying result. \u201d The detective seated himself in the arm-chair, and puffed complacently at his cigar. Then suddenly he slapped his thigh in a paroxysm of amusement. \u201cThe fun of it is,\u201d he cried, \u201cthat that fool Lestrade, who thinks himself so smart, has gone off upon the wrong track altogether. He is after the secretary Stangerson, who had no more to do with the crime than the babe unborn. I have no doubt that he has caught him by this time. \u201d The idea tickled Gregson so much that he laughed until he choked. \u201cAnd how did you get your clue? \u201d \u201cAh, I\u2019ll tell you all about it. Of course, Doctor Watson, this is strictly between ourselves. The first difficulty which we had to contend with was the finding of this American\u2019s antecedents. Some people would have waited until their advertisements were answered, or until parties came forward and volunteered information. That is not Tobias Gregson\u2019s way of going to work. You remember the hat beside the dead man? \u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Holmes; \u201cby John Underwood and Sons, 129, Camberwell Road. \u201d Gregson looked quite crest-fallen. \u201cI had no idea that you noticed that,\u201d he said. \u201cHave you been there? \u201d \u201cNo. \u201d \u201cHa! \u201d cried Gregson, in a relieved voice; \u201cyou should never neglect a chance, however small it may seem. \u201d \u201cTo a great mind, nothing is little,\u201d remarked Holmes, sententiously. \u201cWell, I went to Underwood, and asked him if he had sold a hat of that size and description. He looked over his books, and came on it at once. He had sent the hat to a Mr. Drebber, residing at Charpentier\u2019s Boarding Establishment, Torquay Terrace. Thus I got at his address. \u201d \u201cSmart--very smart! \u201d murmured Sherlock Holmes. \u201cI next called upon Madame Charpentier,\u201d continued the detective. \u201cI found her very pale and distressed.

Besides, you do not know how much we know of it. \u2019 \u201c\u2018On your head be it, Alice! \u2019 cried her mother; and then, turning to me, \u2018I will tell you all, sir. Do not imagine that my agitation on behalf of my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand in this terrible affair. He is utterly innocent of it. My dread is, however, that in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to be compromised. That however is surely impossible. His high character, his profession, his antecedents would all forbid it. \u2019 \u201c\u2018Your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts,\u2019 I answered. \u2018Depend upon it, if your son is innocent he will be none the worse. \u2019 \u201c\u2018Perhaps, Alice, you had better leave us together,\u2019 she said, and her daughter withdrew. \u2018Now, sir,\u2019 she continued, \u2018I had no intention of telling you all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it I have no alternative. Having once decided to speak, I will tell you all without omitting any particular. \u2019 \u201c\u2018It is your wisest course,\u2019 said I. \u201c\u2018Mr. Drebber has been with us nearly three weeks. He and his secretary, Mr. Stangerson, had been travelling on the Continent. I noticed a \u201cCopenhagen\u201d label upon each of their trunks, showing that that had been their last stopping place. Stangerson was a quiet reserved man, but his employer, I am sorry to say, was far otherwise. He was coarse in his habits and brutish in his ways. The very night of his arrival he became very much the worse for drink, and, indeed, after twelve o\u2019clock in the day he could hardly ever be said to be sober. His manners towards the maid-servants were disgustingly free and familiar. Worst of all, he speedily assumed the same attitude towards my daughter, Alice, and spoke to her more than once in a way which, fortunately, she is too innocent to understand. On one occasion he actually seized her in his arms and embraced her--an outrage which caused his own secretary to reproach him for his unmanly conduct. \u2019 \u201c\u2018But why did you stand all this,\u2019 I asked. \u2018I suppose that you can get rid of your boarders when you wish. \u2019 \u201cMrs. Charpentier blushed at my pertinent question. \u2018Would to God that I had given him notice on the very day that he came,\u2019 she said. \u2018But it was a sore temptation. They were paying a pound a day each--fourteen pounds a week, and this is the slack season. I am a widow, and my boy in the Navy has cost me much. I grudged to lose the money. I acted for the best. This last was too much, however, and I gave him notice to leave on account of it. That was the reason of his going. \u2019 \u201c\u2018Well? \u2019 \u201c\u2018My heart grew light when I saw him drive away.

He was much excited, and evidently the worse for drink. He forced his way into the room, where I was sitting with my daughter, and made some incoherent remark about having missed his train. He then turned to Alice, and before my very face, proposed to her that she should fly with him. \u201cYou are of age,\u201d he said, \u201cand there is no law to stop you. I have money enough and to spare. Never mind the old girl here, but come along with me now straight away. You shall live like a princess. \u201d Poor Alice was so frightened that she shrunk away from him, but he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured to draw her towards the door. I screamed, and at that moment my son Arthur came into the room. What happened then I do not know. I heard oaths and the confused sounds of a scuffle. I was too terrified to raise my head. When I did look up I saw Arthur standing in the doorway laughing, with a stick in his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t think that fine fellow will trouble us again,\u201d he said. \u201cI will just go after him and see what he does with himself. \u201d With those words he took his hat and started off down the street. The next morning we heard of Mr. Drebber\u2019s mysterious death. \u2019 \u201cThis statement came from Mrs. Charpentier\u2019s lips with many gasps and pauses. At times she spoke so low that I could hardly catch the words. I made shorthand notes of all that she said, however, so that there should be no possibility of a mistake. \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s quite exciting,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, with a yawn. \u201cWhat happened next? \u201d \u201cWhen Mrs. Charpentier paused,\u201d the detective continued, \u201cI saw that the whole case hung upon one point. Fixing her with my eye in a way which I always found effective with women, I asked her at what hour her son returned. \u201c\u2018I do not know,\u2019 she answered. \u201c\u2018Not know? \u2019 \u201c\u2018No; he has a latch-key, and he let himself in. \u2019 \u201c\u2018After you went to bed? \u2019 \u201c\u2018Yes. \u2019 \u201c\u2018When did you go to bed? \u2019 \u201c\u2018About eleven. \u2019 \u201c\u2018So your son was gone at least two hours? \u2019 \u201c\u2018Yes. \u2019 \u201c\u2018Possibly four or five? \u2019 \u201c\u2018Yes. \u2019 \u201c\u2018What was he doing during that time? \u2019 \u201c\u2018I do not know,\u2019 she answered, turning white to her very lips. \u201cOf course after that there was nothing more to be done. I found out where Lieutenant Charpentier was, took two officers with me, and arrested him. When I touched him on the shoulder and warned him to come quietly with us, he answered us as bold as brass, \u2018I suppose you are arresting me for being concerned in the death of that scoundrel Drebber,\u2019 he said. We had said nothing to him about it, so that his alluding to it had a most suspicious aspect. \u201d \u201cVery,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cHe still carried the heavy stick which the mother described him as having with him when he followed Drebber. It was a stout oak cudgel. \u201d \u201cWhat is your theory, then? \u201d \u201cWell, my theory is that he followed Drebber as far as the Brixton Road. When there, a fresh altercation arose between them, in the course of which Drebber received a blow from the stick, in the pit of the stomach, perhaps, which killed him without leaving any mark. The night was so wet that no one was about, so Charpentier dragged the body of his victim into the empty house. As to the candle, and the blood, and the writing on the wall, and the ring, they may all be so many tricks to throw the police on to the wrong scent. \u201d \u201cWell done! \u201d said Holmes in an encouraging voice. \u201cReally, Gregson, you are getting along. We shall make something of you yet. \u201d \u201cI flatter myself that I have managed it rather neatly,\u201d the detective answered proudly. \u201cThe young man volunteered a statement, in which he said that after following Drebber some time, the latter perceived him, and took a cab in order to get away from him. On his way home he met an old shipmate, and took a long walk with him. On being asked where this old shipmate lived, he was unable to give any satisfactory reply.

The assurance and jauntiness which generally marked his demeanour and dress were, however, wanting. His face was disturbed and troubled, while his clothes were disarranged and untidy. He had evidently come with the intention of consulting with Sherlock Holmes, for on perceiving his colleague he appeared to be embarrassed and put out. He stood in the centre of the room, fumbling nervously with his hat and uncertain what to do. \u201cThis is a most extraordinary case,\u201d he said at last--\u201ca most incomprehensible affair. \u201d \u201cAh, you find it so, Mr. Lestrade! \u201d cried Gregson, triumphantly. \u201cI thought you would come to that conclusion.

Gregson sprang out of his chair and upset the remainder of his whiskey and water. I stared in silence at Sherlock Holmes, whose lips were compressed and his brows drawn down over his eyes. \u201cStangerson too! \u201d he muttered. \u201cThe plot thickens. \u201d \u201cIt was quite thick enough before,\u201d grumbled Lestrade, taking a chair. \u201cI seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war. \u201d \u201cAre you--are you sure of this piece of intelligence? \u201d stammered Gregson. \u201cI have just come from his room,\u201d said Lestrade. \u201cI was the first to discover what had occurred. \u201d \u201cWe have been hearing Gregson\u2019s view of the matter,\u201d Holmes observed. \u201cWould you mind letting us know what you have seen and done? \u201d \u201cI have no objection,\u201d Lestrade answered, seating himself. \u201cI freely confess that I was of the opinion that Stangerson was concerned in the death of Drebber. This fresh development has shown me that I was completely mistaken. Full of the one idea, I set myself to find out what had become of the Secretary. They had been seen together at Euston Station about half-past eight on the evening of the third. At two in the morning Drebber had been found in the Brixton Road. The question which confronted me was to find out how Stangerson had been employed between 8.30 and the time of the crime, and what had become of him afterwards. I telegraphed to Liverpool, giving a description of the man, and warning them to keep a watch upon the American boats. I then set to work calling upon all the hotels and lodging-houses in the vicinity of Euston. You see, I argued that if Drebber and his companion had become separated, the natural course for the latter would be to put up somewhere in the vicinity for the night, and then to hang about the station again next morning. \u201d \u201cThey would be likely to agree on some meeting-place beforehand,\u201d remarked Holmes. \u201cSo it proved. I spent the whole of yesterday evening in making enquiries entirely without avail. This morning I began very early, and at eight o\u2019clock I reached Halliday\u2019s Private Hotel, in Little George Street. On my enquiry as to whether a Mr. Stangerson was living there, they at once answered me in the affirmative. \u201c\u2018No doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting,\u2019 they said. \u2018He has been waiting for a gentleman for two days. \u2019 \u201c\u2018Where is he now? \u2019 I asked. \u201c\u2018He is upstairs in bed. He wished to be called at nine. \u2019 \u201c\u2018I will go up and see him at once,\u2019 I said. \u201cIt seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves and lead him to say something unguarded. The Boots volunteered to show me the room: it was on the second floor, and there was a small corridor leading up to it. The Boots pointed out the door to me, and was about to go downstairs again when I saw something that made me feel sickish, in spite of my twenty years\u2019 experience.

I gave a cry, which brought the Boots back. He nearly fainted when he saw it. The door was locked on the inside, but we put our shoulders to it, and knocked it in. The window of the room was open, and beside the window, all huddled up, lay the body of a man in his nightdress. He was quite dead, and had been for some time, for his limbs were rigid and cold. When we turned him over, the Boots recognized him at once as being the same gentleman who had engaged the room under the name of Joseph Stangerson. The cause of death was a deep stab in the left side, which must have penetrated the heart. And now comes the strangest part of the affair. What do you suppose was above the murdered man? \u201d I felt a creeping of the flesh, and a presentiment of coming horror, even before Sherlock Holmes answered. \u201cThe word RACHE, written in letters of blood,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was it,\u201d said Lestrade, in an awe-struck voice; and we were all silent for a while. There was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the deeds of this unknown assassin, that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to his crimes. My nerves, which were steady enough on the field of battle tingled as I thought of it. \u201cThe man was seen,\u201d continued Lestrade. \u201cA milk boy, passing on his way to the dairy, happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews at the back of the hotel. He noticed that a ladder, which usually lay there, was raised against one of the windows of the second floor, which was wide open. After passing, he looked back and saw a man descend the ladder. He came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to be some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel. He took no particular notice of him, beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for him to be at work. He has an impression that the man was tall, had a reddish face, and was dressed in a long, brownish coat. He must have stayed in the room some little time after the murder, for we found blood-stained water in the basin, where he had washed his hands, and marks on the sheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife. \u201d I glanced at Holmes on hearing the description of the murderer, which tallied so exactly with his own. There was, however, no trace of exultation or satisfaction upon his face. \u201cDid you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the murderer? \u201d he asked. \u201cNothing. Stangerson had Drebber\u2019s purse in his pocket, but it seems that this was usual, as he did all the paying. There was eighty odd pounds in it, but nothing had been taken. Whatever the motives of these extraordinary crimes, robbery is certainly not one of them. There were no papers or memoranda in the murdered man\u2019s pocket, except a single telegram, dated from Cleveland about a month ago, and containing the words, \u2018J. H. is in Europe. \u2019 There was no name appended to this message. \u201d \u201cAnd there was nothing else? \u201d Holmes asked. \u201cNothing of any importance. The man\u2019s novel, with which he had read himself to sleep was lying upon the bed, and his pipe was on a chair beside him. There was a glass of water on the table, and on the window-sill a small chip ointment box containing a couple of pills. \u201d Sherlock Holmes sprang from his chair with an exclamation of delight. \u201cThe last link,\u201d he cried, exultantly. \u201cMy case is complete. \u201d The two detectives stared at him in amazement. \u201cI have now in my hands,\u201d my companion said, confidently, \u201call the threads which have formed such a tangle. There are, of course, details to be filled in, but I am as certain of all the main facts, from the time that Drebber parted from Stangerson at the station, up to the discovery of the body of the latter, as if I had seen them with my own eyes. I will give you a proof of my knowledge. Could you lay your hand upon those pills? \u201d \u201cI have them,\u201d said Lestrade, producing a small white box; \u201cI took them and the purse and the telegram, intending to have them put in a place of safety at the Police Station.

They were of a pearly grey colour, small, round, and almost transparent against the light. \u201cFrom their lightness and transparency, I should imagine that they are soluble in water,\u201d I remarked. \u201cPrecisely so,\u201d answered Holmes. \u201cNow would you mind going down and fetching that poor little devil of a terrier which has been bad so long, and which the landlady wanted you to put out of its pain yesterday. \u201d I went downstairs and carried the dog upstair in my arms. It\u2019s laboured breathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end. Indeed, its snow-white muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceeded the usual term of canine existence. I placed it upon a cushion on the rug. \u201cI will now cut one of these pills in two,\u201d said Holmes, and drawing his penknife he suited the action to the word. \u201cOne half we return into the box for future purposes. The other half I will place in this wine glass, in which is a teaspoonful of water. You perceive that our friend, the Doctor, is right, and that it readily dissolves. \u201d \u201cThis may be very interesting,\u201d said Lestrade, in the injured tone of one who suspects that he is being laughed at, \u201cI cannot see, however, what it has to do with the death of Mr. Joseph Stangerson. \u201d \u201cPatience, my friend, patience! You will find in time that it has everything to do with it. I shall now add a little milk to make the mixture palatable, and on presenting it to the dog we find that he laps it up readily enough. \u201d As he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer and placed it in front of the terrier, who speedily licked it dry. Sherlock Holmes\u2019 earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in silence, watching the animal intently, and expecting some startling effect. None such appeared, however. The dog continued to lie stretched upon tho [16] cushion, breathing in a laboured way, but apparently neither the better nor the worse for its draught. Holmes had taken out his watch, and as minute followed minute without result, an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared upon his features. He gnawed his lip, drummed his fingers upon the table, and showed every other symptom of acute impatience. So great was his emotion, that I felt sincerely sorry for him, while the two detectives smiled derisively, by no means displeased at this check which he had met. \u201cIt can\u2019t be a coincidence,\u201d he cried, at last springing from his chair and pacing wildly up and down the room; \u201cit is impossible that it should be a mere coincidence. The very pills which I suspected in the case of Drebber are actually found after the death of Stangerson. And yet they are inert. What can it mean? Surely my whole chain of reasoning cannot have been false. It is impossible! And yet this wretched dog is none the worse. Ah, I have it! I have it! \u201d With a perfect shriek of delight he rushed to the box, cut the other pill in two, dissolved it, added milk, and presented it to the terrier. The unfortunate creature\u2019s tongue seemed hardly to have been moistened in it before it gave a convulsive shiver in every limb, and lay as rigid and lifeless as if it had been struck by lightning. Sherlock Holmes drew a long breath, and wiped the perspiration from his forehead. \u201cI should have more faith,\u201d he said; \u201cI ought to know by this time that when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train of deductions, it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some other interpretation. Of the two pills in that box one was of the most deadly poison, and the other was entirely harmless. I ought to have known that before ever I saw the box at all. \u201d This last statement appeared to me to be so startling, that I could hardly believe that he was in his sober senses. There was the dead dog, however, to prove that his conjecture had been correct. It seemed to me that the mists in my own mind were gradually'), NULL);

I had the good fortune to seize upon that, and everything which has occurred since then has served to confirm my original supposition, and, indeed, was the logical sequence of it. Hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more obscure, have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions. It is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery. The most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn. This murder would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those _outr\u00e9_ and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it remarkable. These strange details, far from making the case more difficult, have really had the effect of making it less so. \u201d Mr. Gregson, who had listened to this address with considerable impatience, could contain himself no longer. \u201cLook here, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\u201d he said, \u201cwe are all ready to acknowledge that you are a smart man, and that you have your own methods of working. We want something more than mere theory and preaching now, though. It is a case of taking the man. I have made my case out, and it seems I was wrong. Young Charpentier could not have been engaged in this second affair. Lestrade went after his man, Stangerson, and it appears that he was wrong too. You have thrown out hints here, and hints there, and seem to know more than we do, but the time has come when we feel that we have a right to ask you straight how much you do know of the business. Can you name the man who did it? \u201d \u201cI cannot help feeling that Gregson is right, sir,\u201d remarked Lestrade. \u201cWe have both tried, and we have both failed. You have remarked more than once since I have been in the room that you had all the evidence which you require. Surely you will not withhold it any longer. \u201d \u201cAny delay in arresting the assassin,\u201d I observed, \u201cmight give him time to perpetrate some fresh atrocity. \u201d Thus pressed by us all, Holmes showed signs of irresolution. He continued to walk up and down the room with his head sunk on his chest and his brows drawn down, as was his habit when lost in thought. \u201cThere will be no more murders,\u201d he said at last, stopping abruptly and facing us. \u201cYou can put that consideration out of the question. You have asked me if I know the name of the assassin. I do. The mere knowing of his name is a small thing, however, compared with the power of laying our hands upon him. This I expect very shortly to do. I have good hopes of managing it through my own arrangements; but it is a thing which needs delicate handling, for we have a shrewd and desperate man to deal with, who is supported, as I have had occasion to prove, by another who is as clever as himself. As long as this man has no idea that anyone can have a clue there is some chance of securing him; but if he had the slightest suspicion, he would change his name, and vanish in an instant among the four million inhabitants of this great city. Without meaning to hurt either of your feelings, I am bound to say that I consider these men to be more than a match for the official force, and that is why I have not asked your assistance. If I fail I shall, of course, incur all the blame due to this omission; but that I am prepared for. At present I am ready to promise that the instant that I can communicate with you without endangering my own combinations, I shall do so. \u201d Gregson and Lestrade seemed to be far from satisfied by this assurance, or by the depreciating allusion to the detective police.

I have a vivid recollection of that instant, of Holmes\u2019 triumphant expression and the ring of his voice, of the cabman\u2019s dazed, savage face, as he glared at the glittering handcuffs, which had appeared as if by magic upon his wrists. For a second or two we might have been a group of statues. Then, with an inarticulate roar of fury, the prisoner wrenched himself free from Holmes\u2019s grasp, and hurled himself through the window. Woodwork and glass gave way before him; but before he got quite through, Gregson, Lestrade, and Holmes sprang upon him like so many staghounds. He was dragged back into the room, and then commenced a terrific conflict. So powerful and so fierce was he, that the four of us were shaken off again and again. He appeared to have the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit. His face and hands were terribly mangled by his passage through the glass, but loss of blood had no effect in diminishing his resistance. It was not until Lestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and half-strangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of no avail; and even then we felt no security until we had pinioned his feet as well as his hands. That done, we rose to our feet breathless and panting. \u201cWe have his cab,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes. \u201cIt will serve to take him to Scotland Yard. And now, gentlemen,\u201d he continued, with a pleasant smile, \u201cwe have reached the end of our little mystery.

Nor is Nature always in one mood throughout this grim district. It comprises snow-capped and lofty mountains, and dark and gloomy valleys. There are swift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged ca\u00f1ons; and there are enormous plains, which in winter are white with snow, and in summer are grey with the saline alkali dust.

The coyote skulks among the scrub, the buzzard flaps heavily through the air, and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through the dark ravines, and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the rocks. These are the sole dwellers in the wilderness. In the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the northern slope of the Sierra Blanco. As far as the eye can reach stretches the great flat plain-land, all dusted over with patches of alkali, and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes. On the extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks, with their rugged summits flecked with snow. In this great stretch of country there is no sign of life, nor of anything appertaining to life. There is no bird in the steel-blue heaven, no movement upon the dull, grey earth--above all, there is absolute silence. Listen as one may, there is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness; nothing but silence--complete and heart-subduing silence. It has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad plain. That is hardly true. Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, one sees a pathway traced out across the desert, which winds away and is lost in the extreme distance. It is rutted with wheels and trodden down by the feet of many adventurers. Here and there there are scattered white objects which glisten in the sun, and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali. Approach, and examine them! They are bones: some large and coarse, others smaller and more delicate. The former have belonged to oxen, and the latter to men. For fifteen hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside. Looking down on this very scene, there stood upon the fourth of May, eighteen hundred and forty-seven, a solitary traveller. His appearance was such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the region. An observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was nearer to forty or to sixty. His face was lean and haggard, and the brown parchment-like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones; his long, brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white; his eyes were sunken in his head, and burned with an unnatural lustre; while the hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of a skeleton. As he stood, he leaned upon his weapon for support, and yet his tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a wiry and vigorous constitution. His gaunt face, however, and his clothes, which hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs, proclaimed what it was that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance. The man was dying--dying from hunger and from thirst. He had toiled painfully down the ravine, and on to this little elevation, in the vain hope of seeing some signs of water. Now the great salt plain stretched before his eyes, and the distant belt of savage mountains, without a sign anywhere of plant or tree, which might indicate the presence of moisture. In all that broad landscape there was no gleam of hope. North, and east, and west he looked with wild questioning eyes, and then he realised that his wanderings had come to an end, and that there, on that barren crag, he was about to die. \u201cWhy not here, as well as in a feather bed, twenty years hence,\u201d he muttered, as he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder. Before sitting down, he had deposited upon the ground his useless rifle, and also a large bundle tied up in a grey shawl, which he had carried slung over his right shoulder. It appeared to be somewhat too heavy for his strength, for in lowering it, it came down on the ground with some little violence. Instantly there broke from the grey parcel a little moaning cry, and from it there protruded a small, scared face, with very bright brown eyes, and two little speckled, dimpled fists. \u201cYou\u2019ve hurt me! \u201d said a childish voice reproach'), NULL);

The child was pale and wan, but her healthy arms and legs showed that she had suffered less than her companion. \u201cHow is it now? \u201d he answered anxiously, for she was still rubbing the towsy golden curls which covered the back of her head. \u201cKiss it and make it well,\u201d she said, with perfect gravity, shoving [19] the injured part up to him. \u201cThat\u2019s what mother used to do.

It ain\u2019t easy to talk when your lips is like leather, but I guess I\u2019d best let you know how the cards lie. What\u2019s that you\u2019ve got? \u201d \u201cPretty things! fine things! \u201d cried the little girl enthusiastically, holding up two glittering fragments of mica. \u201cWhen we goes back to home I\u2019ll give them to brother Bob. \u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll see prettier things than them soon,\u201d said the man confidently. \u201cYou just wait a bit.

Then I thought there was some chance of water in this direction, so I heaved you over my shoulder and we tramped it together. It don\u2019t seem as though we\u2019ve improved matters. There\u2019s an almighty small chance for us now! \u201d \u201cDo you mean that we are going to die too? \u201d asked the child, checking her sobs, and raising her tear-stained face. \u201cI guess that\u2019s about the size of it. \u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say so before? \u201d she said, laughing gleefully. \u201cYou gave me such a fright. Why, of course, now as long as we die we\u2019ll be with mother again. \u201d \u201cYes, you will, dearie. \u201d \u201cAnd you too. I\u2019ll tell her how awful good you\u2019ve been.

In the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared three little specks which increased in size every moment, so rapidly did they approach. They speedily resolved themselves into three large brown birds, which circled over the heads of the two wanderers, and then settled upon some rocks which overlooked them. They were buzzards, the vultures of the west, whose coming is the forerunner of death. \u201cCocks and hens,\u201d cried the little girl gleefully, pointing at their ill-omened forms, and clapping her hands to make them rise. \u201cSay, did God make this country? \u201d \u201cIn course He did,\u201d said her companion, rather startled by this unexpected question. \u201cHe made the country down in Illinois, and He made the Missouri,\u201d the little girl continued. \u201cI guess somebody else made the country in these parts.

Side by side on the narrow shawl knelt the two wanderers, the little prattling child and the reckless, hardened adventurer. Her chubby face, and his haggard, angular visage were both turned up to the cloudless heaven in heartfelt entreaty to that dread being with whom they were face to face, while the two voices--the one thin and clear, the other deep and harsh--united in the entreaty for mercy and forgiveness. The prayer finished, they resumed their seat in the shadow of the boulder until the child fell asleep, nestling upon the broad breast of her protector. He watched over her slumber for some time, but Nature proved to be too strong for him. For three days and three nights he had allowed himself neither rest nor repose. Slowly the eyelids drooped over the tired eyes, and the head sunk lower and lower upon the breast, until the man\u2019s grizzled beard was mixed with the gold tresses of his companion, and both slept the same deep and dreamless slumber. Had the wanderer remained awake for another half hour a strange sight would have met his eyes. Far away on the extreme verge of the alkali plain there rose up a little spray of dust, very slight at first, and hardly to be distinguished from the mists of the distance, but gradually growing higher and broader until it formed a solid, well-defined cloud. This cloud continued to increase in size until it became evident that it could only be raised by a great multitude of moving creatures. In more fertile spots the observer would have come to the conclusion that one of those great herds of bisons which graze upon the prairie land was approaching him. This was obviously impossible in these arid wilds. As the whirl of dust drew nearer to the solitary bluff upon which the two castaways were reposing, the canvas-covered tilts of waggons and the figures of armed horsemen began to show up through the haze, and the apparition revealed itself as being a great caravan upon its journey for the West. But what a caravan! When the head of it had reached the base of the mountains, the rear was not yet visible on the horizon. Right across the enormous plain stretched the straggling array, waggons and carts, men on horseback, and men on foot. Innumerable women who staggered along under burdens, and children who toddled beside the waggons or peeped out from under the white coverings. This was evidently no ordinary party of immigrants, but rather some nomad people who had been compelled from stress of circumstances to seek themselves a new country. There rose through the clear air a confused clattering and rumbling from this great mass of humanity, with the creaking of wheels and the neighing of horses. Loud as it was, it was not sufficient to rouse the two tired wayfarers above them. At the head of the column there rode a score or more of grave ironfaced men, clad in sombre homespun garments and armed with rifles. On reaching the base of the bluff they halted, and held a short council among themselves. \u201cThe wells are to the right, my brothers,\u201d said one, a hard-lipped, clean-shaven man with grizzly hair. \u201cTo the right of the Sierra Blanco--so we shall reach the Rio Grande,\u201d said another. \u201cFear not for water,\u201d cried a third. \u201cHe who could draw it from the rocks will not now abandon His own chosen people. \u201d \u201cAmen!

From its summit there fluttered a little wisp of pink, showing up hard and bright against the grey rocks behind. At the sight there was a general reining up of horses and unslinging of guns, while fresh horsemen came galloping up to reinforce the vanguard. The word \u2018Redskins\u2019 was on every lip. \u201cThere can\u2019t be any number of Injuns here,\u201d said the elderly man who appeared to be in command. \u201cWe have passed the Pawnees, and there are no other tribes until we cross the great mountains. \u201d \u201cShall I go forward and see, Brother Stangerson,\u201d asked one of the band. \u201cAnd I,\u201d \u201cand I,\u201d cried a dozen voices. \u201cLeave your horses below and we will await you here,\u201d the Elder answered. In a moment the young fellows had dismounted, fastened their horses, and were ascending the precipitous slope which led up to the object which had excited their curiosity. They advanced rapidly and noiselessly, with the confidence and dexterity of practised scouts. The watchers from the plain below could see them flit from rock to rock until their figures stood out against the skyline. The young man who had first given the alarm was leading them. Suddenly his followers saw him throw up his hands, as though overcome with astonishment, and on joining him they were affected in the same way by the sight which met their eyes. On the little plateau which crowned the barren hill there stood a single giant boulder, and against this boulder there lay a tall man, long-bearded and hard-featured, but of an excessive thinness. His placid face and regular breathing showed that he was fast asleep. Beside him lay a little child, with her round white arms encircling his brown sinewy neck, and her golden haired head resting upon the breast of his velveteen tunic. Her rosy lips were parted, showing the regular line of snow-white teeth within, and a playful smile played over her infantile features. Her plump little white legs terminating in white socks and neat shoes with shining buckles, offered a strange contrast to the long shrivelled members of her companion. On the ledge of rock above this strange couple there stood three solemn buzzards, who, at the sight of the new comers uttered raucous screams of disappointment and flapped sullenly away. The cries of the foul birds awoke the two sleepers who stared about [20] them in bewilderment. The man staggered to his feet and looked down upon the plain which had been so desolate when sleep had overtaken him, and which was now traversed by this enormous body of men and of beasts. His face assumed an expression of incredulity as he gazed, and he passed his boney hand over his eyes. \u201cThis is what they call delirium, I guess,\u201d he muttered. The child stood beside him, holding on to the skirt of his coat, and said nothing but looked all round her with the wondering questioning gaze of childhood. The rescuing party were speedily able to convince the two castaways that their appearance was no delusion. One of them seized the little girl, and hoisted her upon his shoulder, while two others supported her gaunt companion, and assisted him towards the waggons. \u201cMy name is John Ferrier,\u201d the wanderer explained; \u201cme and that little un are all that\u2019s left o\u2019 twenty-one people.

Many were the cries of astonishment and of commiseration which arose from them when they perceived the youth of one of the strangers and the destitution of the other. Their escort did not halt, however, but pushed on, followed by a great crowd of Mormons, until they reached a waggon, which was conspicuous for its great size and for the gaudiness and smartness of its appearance. Six horses were yoked to it, whereas the others were furnished with two, or, at most, four a-piece. Beside the driver there sat a man who could not have been more than thirty years of age, but whose massive head and resolute expression marked him as a leader. He was reading a brown-backed volume, but as the crowd approached he laid it aside, and listened attentively to an account of the episode. Then he turned to the two castaways. \u201cIf we take you with us,\u201d he said, in solemn words, \u201cit can only be as believers in our own creed. We shall have no wolves in our fold. Better far that your bones should bleach in this wilderness than that you should prove to be that little speck of decay which in time corrupts the whole fruit. Will you come with us on these terms? \u201d \u201cGuess I\u2019ll come with you on any terms,\u201d said Ferrier, with such emphasis that the grave Elders could not restrain a smile. The leader alone retained his stern, impressive expression. \u201cTake him, Brother Stangerson,\u201d he said, \u201cgive him food and drink, and the child likewise. Let it be your task also to teach him our holy creed. We have delayed long enough. Forward! On, on to Zion! \u201d \u201cOn, on to Zion! \u201d cried the crowd of Mormons, and the words rippled down the long caravan, passing from mouth to mouth until they died away in a dull murmur in the far distance. With a cracking of whips and a creaking of wheels the great waggons got into motion, and soon the whole caravan was winding along once more. The Elder to whose care the two waifs had been committed, led them to his waggon, where a meal was already awaiting them. \u201cYou shall remain here,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a few days you will have recovered from your fatigues.

The savage man, and the savage beast, hunger, thirst, fatigue, and disease--every impediment which Nature could place in the way, had all been overcome with Anglo-Saxon tenacity. Yet the long journey and the accumulated terrors had shaken the hearts of the stoutest among them. There was not one who did not sink upon his knees in heartfelt prayer when they saw the broad valley of Utah bathed in the sunlight beneath them, and learned from the lips of their leader that this was the promised land, and that these virgin acres were to be theirs for evermore.

All around farms were apportioned and allotted in proportion to the standing of each individual. The tradesman was put to his trade and the artisan to his calling. In the town streets and squares sprang up, as if by magic. In the country there was draining and hedging, planting and clearing, until the next summer saw the whole country golden with the wheat crop. Everything prospered in the strange settlement. Above all, the great temple which they had erected in the centre of the city grew ever taller and larger. From the first blush of dawn until the closing of the twilight, the clatter of the hammer and the rasp of the saw was never absent from the monument which the immigrants erected to Him who had led them safe through many dangers. The two castaways, John Ferrier and the little girl who had shared his fortunes and had been adopted as his daughter, accompanied the Mormons to the end of their great pilgrimage. Little Lucy Ferrier was borne along pleasantly enough in Elder Stangerson\u2019s waggon, a retreat which she shared with the Mormon\u2019s three wives and with his son, a headstrong forward boy of twelve. Having rallied, with the elasticity of childhood, from the shock caused by her mother\u2019s death, she soon became a pet with the women, and reconciled herself to this new life in her moving canvas-covered home. In the meantime Ferrier having recovered from his privations, distinguished himself as a useful guide and an indefatigable hunter. So rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new companions, that when they reached the end of their wanderings, it was unanimously agreed that he should be provided with as large and as fertile a tract of land as any of the settlers, with the exception of Young himself, and of Stangerson, Kemball, Johnston, and Drebber, who were the four principal Elders. On the farm thus acquired John Ferrier built himself a substantial log-house, which received so many additions in succeeding years that it grew into a roomy villa. He was a man of a practical turn of mind, keen in his dealings and skilful with his hands. His iron constitution enabled him to work morning and evening at improving and tilling his lands. Hence it came about that his farm and all that belonged to him prospered exceedingly. In three years he was better off than his neighbours, in six he was well-to-do, in nine he was rich, and in twelve there were not half a dozen men in the whole of Salt Lake City who could compare with him. From the great inland sea to the distant Wahsatch Mountains there was no name better known than that of John Ferrier. There was one way and only one in which he offended the susceptibilities of his co-religionists. No argument or persuasion could ever induce him to set up a female establishment after the manner of his companions. He never gave reasons for this persistent refusal, but contented himself by resolutely and inflexibly adhering to his determination. There were some who accused him of lukewarmness in his adopted religion, and others who put it down to greed of wealth and reluctance to incur expense. Others, again, spoke of some early love affair, and of a fair-haired girl who had pined away on the shores of the Atlantic. Whatever the reason, Ferrier remained strictly celibate. In every other respect he conformed to the religion of the young settlement, and gained the name of being an orthodox and straight-walking man. Lucy Ferrier grew up within the log-house, and assisted her adopted father in all his undertakings. The keen air of the mountains and the balsamic odour of the pine trees took the place of nurse and mother to the young girl. As year succeeded to year she grew taller and stronger, her cheek more rudy, and her step more elastic. Many a wayfarer upon the high road which ran by Ferrier\u2019s farm felt long-forgotten thoughts revive in their mind as they watched her lithe girlish figure tripping through the wheatfields, or met her mounted upon her father\u2019s mustang, and managing it with'), NULL);

So the bud blossomed into a flower, and the year which saw her father the richest of the farmers left her as fair a specimen of American girlhood as could be found in the whole Pacific slope. It was not the father, however, who first discovered that the child had developed into the woman. It seldom is in such cases. That mysterious change is too subtle and too gradual to be measured by dates. Least of all does the maiden herself know it until the tone of a voice or the touch of a hand sets her heart thrilling within her, and she learns, with a mixture of pride and of fear, that a new and a larger nature has awoken within her. There are few who cannot recall that day and remember the one little incident which heralded the dawn of a new life. In the case of Lucy Ferrier the occasion was serious enough in itself, apart from its future influence on her destiny and that of many besides. It was a warm June morning, and the Latter Day Saints were as busy as the bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem. In the fields and in the streets rose the same hum of human industry. Down the dusty high roads defiled long streams of heavily-laden mules, all heading to the west, for the gold fever had broken out in California, and the Overland Route lay through the City of the Elect. There, too, were droves of sheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands, and trains of tired immigrants, men and horses equally weary of their interminable journey. Through all this motley assemblage, threading her way with the skill of an accomplished rider, there galloped Lucy Ferrier, her fair face flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut hair floating out behind her. She had a commission from her father in the City, and was dashing in as she had done many a time before, with all the fearlessness of youth, thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed. The travel-stained adventurers gazed after her in astonishment, and even the unemotional Indians, journeying in with their pelties, relaxed their accustomed stoicism as they marvelled at the beauty of the pale-faced maiden. She had reached the outskirts of the city when she found the road blocked by a great drove of cattle, driven by a half-dozen wild-looking herdsmen from the plains. In her impatience she endeavoured to pass this obstacle by pushing her horse into what appeared to be a gap. Scarcely had she got fairly into it, however, before the beasts closed in behind her, and she found herself completely imbedded in the moving stream of fierce-eyed, long-horned bullocks. Accustomed as she was to deal with cattle, she was not alarmed at her situation, but took advantage of every opportunity to urge her horse on in the hopes of pushing her way through the cavalcade. Unfortunately the horns of one of the creatures, either by accident or design, came in violent contact with the flank of the mustang, and excited it to madness. In an instant it reared up upon its hind legs with a snort of rage, and pranced and tossed in a way that would have unseated any but a most skilful rider. The situation was full of peril. Every plunge of the excited horse brought it against the horns again, and goaded it to fresh madness. It was all that the girl could do to keep herself in the saddle, yet a slip would mean a terrible death under the hoofs of the unwieldy and terrified animals. Unaccustomed to sudden emergencies, her head began to swim, and her grip upon the bridle to relax. Choked by the rising cloud of dust and by the steam from the struggling creatures, she might have abandoned her efforts in despair, but for a kindly voice at her elbow which assured her of assistance. At the same moment a sinewy brown hand caught the frightened horse by the curb, and forcing a way through the drove, soon brought her to the outskirts. \u201cYou\u2019re not hurt, I hope, miss,\u201d said her preserver, respectfully.

You ain\u2019t even a friend of ours. \u201d The young hunter\u2019s dark face grew so gloomy over this remark that Lucy Ferrier laughed aloud. \u201cThere, I didn\u2019t mean that,\u201d she said; \u201cof course, you are a friend now. You must come and see us. Now I must push along, or father won\u2019t trust me with his business any more. Good-bye! \u201d \u201cGood-bye,\u201d he answered, raising his broad sombrero, and bending over her little hand. She wheeled her mustang round, gave it a cut with her riding-whip, and darted away down the broad road in a rolling cloud of dust. Young Jefferson Hope rode on with his companions, gloomy and taciturn. He and they had been among the Nevada Mountains prospecting for silver, and were returning to Salt Lake City in the hope of raising capital enough to work some lodes which they had discovered. He had been as keen as any of them upon the business until this sudden incident had drawn his thoughts into another channel. The sight of the fair young girl, as frank and wholesome as the Sierra breezes, had stirred his volcanic, untamed heart to its very depths. When she had vanished from his sight, he realized that a crisis had come in his life, and that neither silver speculations nor any other questions could ever be of such importance to him as this new and all-absorbing one. The love which had sprung up in his heart was not the sudden, changeable fancy of a boy, but rather the wild, fierce passion of a man of strong will and imperious temper. He had been accustomed to succeed in all that he undertook. He swore in his heart that he would not fail in this if human effort and human perseverance could render him successful. He called on John Ferrier that night, and many times again, until his face was a familiar one at the farm-house. John, cooped up in the valley, and absorbed in his work, had had little chance of learning the news of the outside world during the last twelve years. All this Jefferson Hope was able to tell him, and in a style which interested Lucy as well as her father. He had been a pioneer in California, and could narrate many a strange tale of fortunes made and fortunes lost in those wild, halcyon days. He had been a scout too, and a trapper, a silver explorer, and a ranchman. Wherever stirring adventures were to be had, Jefferson Hope had been there in search of them. He soon became a favourite with the old farmer, who spoke eloquently of his virtues. On such occasions, Lucy was silent, but her blushing cheek and her bright, happy eyes, showed only too clearly that her young heart was no longer her own. Her honest father may not have observed these symptoms, but they were assuredly not thrown away upon the man who had won her affections. It was a summer evening when he came galloping down the road and pulled up at the gate. She was at the doorway, and came down to meet him. He threw the bridle over the fence and strode up the pathway. \u201cI am off, Lucy,\u201d he said, taking her two hands in his, and gazing tenderly down into her face; \u201cI won\u2019t ask you to come wit'), NULL);

John Ferrier\u2019s heart was sore within him when he thought of the young man\u2019s return, and of the impending loss of his adopted child. Yet her bright and happy face reconciled him to the arrangement more than any argument could have done. He had always determined, deep down in his resolute heart, that nothing would ever induce him to allow his daughter to wed a Mormon. Such a marriage he regarded as no marriage at all, but as a shame and a disgrace. Whatever he might think of the Mormon doctrines, upon that one point he was inflexible. He had to seal his mouth on the subject, however, for to express an unorthodox opinion was a dangerous matter in those days in the Land of the Saints. Yes, a dangerous matter--so dangerous that even the most saintly dared only whisper their religious opinions with bated breath, lest something which fell from their lips might be misconstrued, and bring down a swift retribution upon them. The victims of persecution had now turned persecutors on their own account, and persecutors of the most terrible description. Not the Inquisition of Seville, nor the German Vehm-gericht, nor the Secret Societies of Italy, were ever able to put a more formidable machinery in motion than that which cast a cloud over the State of Utah. Its invisibility, and the mystery which was attached to it, made this organization doubly terrible. It appeared to be omniscient and omnipotent, and yet was neither seen nor heard. The man who held out against the Church vanished away, and none knew whither he had gone or what had befallen him. His wife and his children awaited him at home, but no father ever returned to tell them how he had fared at the hands of his secret judges. A rash word or a hasty act was followed by annihilation, and yet none knew what the nature might be of this terrible power which was suspended over them. No wonder that men went about in fear and trembling, and that even in the heart of the wilderness they dared not whisper the doubts which oppressed them. At first this vague and terrible power was exercised only upon the recalcitrants who, having embraced the Mormon faith, wished afterwards to pervert or to abandon it. Soon, however, it took a wider range. The supply of adult women was running short, and polygamy without a female population on which to draw was a barren doctrine indeed. Strange rumours began to be bandied about--rumours of murdered immigrants and rifled camps in regions where Indians had never been seen. Fresh women appeared in the harems of the Elders--women who pined and wept, and bore upon their faces the traces of an unextinguishable horror.

These tales and rumours took substance and shape, and were corroborated and re-corroborated, until they resolved themselves into a definite name. To this day, in the lonely ranches of the West, the name of the Danite Band, or the Avenging Angels, is a sinister and an ill-omened one. Fuller knowledge of the organization which produced such terrible results served to increase rather than to lessen the horror which it inspired in the minds of men. None knew who belonged to this ruthless society. The names of the participators in the deeds of blood and violence done under the name of religion were kept profoundly secret. The very friend to whom you communicated your misgivings as to the Prophet and his mission, might be one of those who would come forth at night with fire and sword to exact a terrible reparation. Hence every man feared his neighbour, and none spoke of the things which were nearest his heart. One fine morning, John Ferrier was about to set out to his wheatfields, when he heard the click of the latch, and, looking through the window, saw a stout, sandy-haired, middle-aged man coming up the pathway. His heart leapt to his mouth, for this was none other than the great Brigham Young himself. Full of trepidation--for he knew that such a visit boded him little good--Ferrier ran to the door to greet the Mormon chief. The latter, however, received his salutations coldly, and followed him with a stern face into the sitting-room. \u201cBrother Ferrier,\u201d he said, taking a seat, and eyeing the farmer keenly from under his light-coloured eyelashes, \u201cthe true believers have been good friends to you. We picked you up when you were starving in the desert, we shared our food with you, led you safe to the Chosen Valley, gave you a goodly share of land, and allowed you to wax rich under our protection. Is not this so? \u201d \u201cIt is so,\u201d answered John Ferrier. \u201cIn return for all this we asked but one condition: that was, that you should embrace the true faith, and conform in every way to its usages. This you promised to do, and this, if common report says truly, you have neglected. \u201d \u201cAnd how have I neglected it? \u201d asked Ferrier, throwing out his hands in expostulation. \u201cHave I not given to the common fund? Have I not attended at the Temple? Have I not----? \u201d \u201cWhere are your wives? \u201d asked Young, looking round him. \u201cCall them in, that I may greet them. \u201d \u201cIt is true that I have not married,\u201d Ferrier answered. \u201cBut women were few, and there were many who had better claims than I. I was not a lonely man: I had my daughter to attend to my wants. \u201d \u201cIt is of that daughter that I would speak to you,\u201d said the leader of the Mormons. \u201cShe has grown to be the flower of Utah, and has found favour in the eyes of many who are high in the land. \u201d John Ferrier groaned internally. \u201cThere are stories of her which I would fain disbelieve--stories that she is sealed to some Gentile. This must be the gossip of idle tongues. What is the thirteenth rule in the code of the sainted Joseph Smith? \u2018Let every maiden of the true faith marry one of the elect; for if she wed a Gentile, she commits a grievous sin. \u2019 This being so, it is impossible that you, who profess the holy creed, should suffer your daughter to violate it. \u201d John Ferrier made no answer, but he played nervously with his riding-whip. \u201cUpon this one point your whole faith shall be tested--so it has been decided in the Sacred Council of Four. The girl is young, and we would not have her wed grey hairs, neither would we deprive her of all choice. We Elders have many heifers, [29] but our children must also be provided. Stangerson has a son, and Drebber has a son, and either of them would gladly welcome your daughter to their house. Let her choose between them. They are young and rich, and of the true faith. What say you to that? \u201d Ferrier remained silent for some little time with his brows knitted. \u201cYou will give us time,\u201d he said at last. \u201cMy daughter is very young--she is scarce of an age to marry. \u201d \u201cShe shall have a month to choose,\u201d said Young, '), NULL);

He was still sitting with his elbows upon his knees, considering how he should broach the matter to his daughter when a soft hand was laid upon his, and looking up, he saw her standing beside him. One glance at her pale, frightened face showed him that she had heard what had passed. \u201cI could not help it,\u201d she said, in answer to his look. \u201cHis voice rang through the house. Oh, father, father, what shall we do? \u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you scare yourself,\u201d he answered, drawing her to him, and passing his broad, rough hand caressingly over her chestnut hair. \u201cWe\u2019ll fix it up somehow or another. You don\u2019t find your fancy kind o\u2019 lessening for this chap, do you? \u201d A sob and a squeeze of his hand was her only answer. \u201cNo; of course not. I shouldn\u2019t care to hear you say you did. He\u2019s a likely lad, and he\u2019s a Christian, which is more than these folk here, in spite o\u2019 all their praying and preaching. There\u2019s a party starting for Nevada to-morrow, and I\u2019ll manage to send him a message letting him know the hole we are in. If I know anything o\u2019 that young man, he\u2019ll be back here with a speed that would whip electro-telegraphs. \u201d Lucy laughed through her tears at her father\u2019s description. \u201cWhen he comes, he will advise us for the best. But it is for you that I am frightened, dear. One hears--one hears such dreadful stories about those who oppose the Prophet: something terrible always happens to them. \u201d \u201cBut we haven\u2019t opposed him yet,\u201d her father answered. \u201cIt will be time to look out for squalls when we do. We have a clear month before us; at the end of that, I guess we had best shin out of Utah. \u201d \u201cLeave Utah! \u201d \u201cThat\u2019s about the size of it. \u201d \u201cBut the farm? \u201d \u201cWe will raise as much as we can in money, and let the rest go. To tell the truth, Lucy, it isn\u2019t the first time I have thought of doing it. I don\u2019t care about knuckling under to any man, as these folk do to their darned prophet. I\u2019m a free-born American, and it\u2019s all new to me. Guess I\u2019m too old to learn. If he comes browsing about this farm, he might chance to run up against a charge of buckshot travelling in the opposite direction. \u201d \u201cBut they won\u2019t let us leave,\u201d his daughter objected. \u201cWait till Jefferson comes, and we\u2019ll soon manage that. In the meantime, don\u2019t you fret yourself, my dearie, and don\u2019t get your eyes swelled up, else he\u2019ll be walking into me when he sees you. There\u2019s nothing to be afeared about, and there\u2019s no danger at all. \u201d John Ferrier uttered these consoling remarks in a very confident tone, but she could not help observing that he paid unusual care to the fastening of the doors that night, and that he carefully cleaned and loaded the rusty old shotgun which hung upon the wall of his bedroom.</Body>\n        </Block>\n    </Chapter>\n    <Chapter id=\"10\" title=\"CHAPTER IV A FLIGHT FOR LIFE.\">\n        <Block>\n            <Body>ON the morning which followed his interview with the Mormon Prophet, John Ferrier went in to Salt Lake City, and having found his acquaintance, who was bound for the Nevada Mountains, he entrusted him with his message to Jefferson Hope. In it he told the young man of the imminent danger which threatened them, and how necessary it was that he should return. Having done thus he felt easier in his mind, and returned home with a lighter heart. As he approached his farm, he was surprised to see a horse hitched to each of the posts of the gate.

Both of them nodded to Ferrier as he entered, and the one in the rocking-chair commenced the conversation. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t know us,\u201d he said. \u201cThis here is the son of Elder Drebber, and I\u2019m Joseph Stangerson, who travelled with you in the desert when the Lord stretched out His hand and gathered you into the true fold. \u201d \u201cAs He will all the nations in His own good time,\u201d said the other in a nasal voice; \u201cHe grindeth slowly but exceeding small. \u201d John Ferrier bowed coldly. He had guessed who his visitors were. \u201cWe have come,\u201d continued Stangerson, \u201cat the advice of our fathers to solicit the hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem good to you and to her. As I have but four wives and Brother Drebber here has seven, it appears to me that my claim is the stronger one. \u201d \u201cNay, nay, Brother Stangerson,\u201d cried the other; \u201cthe question is not how many wives we have, but how many we can keep. My father has now given over his mills to me, and I am the richer man. \u201d \u201cBut my prospects are better,\u201d said the other, warmly. \u201cWhen the Lord removes my father, I shall have his tanning yard and his leather factory. Then I am your elder, and am higher in the Church. \u201d \u201cIt will be for the maiden to decide,\u201d rejoined young Drebber, smirking at his own reflection in the glass. \u201cWe will leave it all to her decision. \u201d During this dialogue, John Ferrier had stood fuming in the doorway, hardly able to keep his riding-whip from the backs of his two visitors. \u201cLook here,\u201d he said at last, striding up to them, \u201cwhen my daughter summons you, you can come, but until then I don\u2019t want to see your faces again. \u201d The two young Mormons stared at him in amazement. In their eyes this competition between them for the maiden\u2019s hand was the highest of honours both to her and her father. \u201cThere are two ways out of the room,\u201d cried Ferrier; \u201cthere is the door, and there is the window. Which do you care to use? \u201d His brown face looked so savage, and his gaunt hands so threatening, that his visitors sprang to their feet and beat a hurried retreat. The old farmer followed them to the door. \u201cLet me know when you have settled which it is to be,\u201d he said, sardonically. \u201cYou shall smart for this! \u201d Stangerson cried, white with rage. \u201cYou have defied the Prophet and the Council of Four. You shall rue it to the end of your days. \u201d \u201cThe hand of the Lord shall be heavy upon you,\u201d cried young Drebber; \u201cHe will arise and smite you! \u201d \u201cThen I\u2019ll start the smiting,\u201d exclaimed Ferrier furiously, and would have rushed upstairs for his gun had not Lucy seized him by the arm and restrained him. Before he could escape from her, the clatter of horses\u2019 hoofs told him that they were beyond his reach. \u201cThe young canting rascals! \u201d he exclaimed, wiping the perspiration from his forehead; \u201cI would sooner see you in your grave, my girl, than the wife of either of them. \u201d \u201cAnd so should I, father,\u201d she answered, with spirit; \u201cbut Jefferson will soon be here. \u201d \u201cYes. It will not be long before he comes. The sooner the better, for we do not know what their next move may be. \u201d It was, indeed, high time that someone capable of giving advice and help should come to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his adopted daughter. In the whole history of the settlement there had never been such a case of rank disobedience to the authority of the Elders. If minor errors were punished so sternly, what would be the fate of this arch rebel. Ferrier knew that his wealth and position would be of no avail to him. Others as well known and as rich as himself had been spirited away before now, and their goods given over to the Church. He was a brave man, but he trembled at the vague, shadowy terrors which hung over him. Any known danger he could face with a firm lip, but this suspense was unnerving. He concealed his fears from his daughter, however, and affected to make light of the whole matter, though she, with the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at'), NULL);

He expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from Young as to his conduct, and he was not mistaken, though it came in an unlooked-for manner. Upon rising next morning he found, to his surprise, a small square of paper pinned on to the coverlet of his bed just over his chest. On it was printed, in bold straggling letters:-- \u201cTwenty-nine days are given you for amendment, and then----\u201d The dash was more fear-inspiring than any threat could have been. How this warning came into his room puzzled John Ferrier sorely, for his servants slept in an outhouse, and the doors and windows had all been secured. He crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his daughter, but the incident struck a chill into his heart. The twenty-nine days were evidently the balance of the month which Young had promised. What strength or courage could avail against an enemy armed with such mysterious powers? The hand which fastened that pin might have struck him to the heart, and he could never have known who had slain him. Still more shaken was he next morning. They had sat down to their breakfast when Lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards. In the centre of the ceiling was scrawled, with a burned stick apparently, the number 28. To his daughter it was unintelligible, and he did not enlighten her. That night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and ward. He saw and he heard nothing, and yet in the morning a great 27 had been painted upon the outside of his door. Thus day followed day; and as sure as morning came he found that his unseen enemies had kept their register, and had marked up in some conspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the month of grace. Sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls, sometimes upon the floors, occasionally they were on small placards stuck upon the garden gate or the railings. With all his vigilance John Ferrier could not discover whence these daily warnings proceeded. A horror which was almost superstitious came upon him at the sight of them. He became haggard and restless, and his eyes had the troubled look of some hunted creature. He had but one hope in life now, and that was for the arrival of the young hunter from Nevada. Twenty had changed to fifteen and fifteen to ten, but there was no news of the absentee. One by one the numbers dwindled down, and still there came no sign of him. Whenever a horseman clattered down the road, or a driver shouted at his team, the old farmer hurried to the gate thinking that help had arrived at last. At last, when he saw five give way to four and that again to three, he lost heart, and abandoned all hope of escape. Single-handed, and with his limited knowledge of the mountains which surrounded the settlement, he knew that he was powerless. The more-frequented roads were strictly watched and guarded, and none could pass along them without an order from the Council. Turn which way he would, there appeared to be no avoiding the blow which hung over him. Yet the old man never wavered in his resolution to part with life itself before he consented to what he regarded as his daughter\u2019s dishonour. He was sitting alone one evening pondering deeply over his troubles, and searching vainly for some way out of them. That morning had shown the figure 2 upon the wall of his house, and the next day would be the last of the allotted time. What was to happen then? All manner of vague and terrible fancies filled his imagination. And his daughter--what was to become of her after he was gone? Was there no escape from the invisible network which was drawn all round them. He sank his head upon the table and sobbed at the thought of his own impotence. What was that? In the silence he heard a gentle scratching sound--low, but very distinct in the quiet of the night. It came from the door of the house. Ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently. There was a pause for a few moments, and then the low insidious sound was repeated. Someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the panels of the door. Was it some midnight assassin who had '), NULL);

Or was it some agent who was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived. John Ferrier felt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook his nerves and chilled his heart. Springing forward he drew the bolt and threw the door open. Outside all was calm and quiet. The night was fine, and the stars were twinkling brightly overhead. The little front garden lay before the farmer\u2019s eyes bounded by the fence and gate, but neither there nor on the road was any human being to be seen. With a sigh of relief, Ferrier looked to right and to left, until happening to glance straight down at his own feet he saw to his astonishment a man lying flat upon his face upon the ground, with arms and legs all asprawl. So unnerved was he at the sight that he leaned up against the wall with his hand to his throat to stifle his inclination to call out. His first thought was that the prostrate figure was that of some wounded or dying man, but as he watched it he saw it writhe along the ground and into the hall with the rapidity and noiselessness of a serpent. Once within the house the man sprang to his feet, closed the door, and revealed to the astonished farmer the fierce face and resolute expression of Jefferson Hope. \u201cGood God! \u201d gasped John Ferrier. \u201cHow you scared me! Whatever made you come in like that. \u201d \u201cGive me food,\u201d the other said, hoarsely. \u201cI have had no time for bite or sup for eight-and-forty hours. \u201d He flung himself upon the [21] cold meat and bread which were still lying upon the table from his host\u2019s supper, and devoured it voraciously. \u201cDoes Lucy bear up well? \u201d he asked, when he had satisfied his hunger. \u201cYes. She does not know the danger,\u201d her father answered. \u201cThat is well. The house is watched on every side. That is why I crawled my way up to it. They may be darned sharp, but they\u2019re not quite sharp enough to catch a Washoe hunter. \u201d John Ferrier felt a different man now that he realized that he had a devoted ally. He seized the young man\u2019s leathery hand and wrung it cordially. \u201cYou\u2019re a man to be proud of,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are not many who would come to share our danger and our troubles. \u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve hit it there, pard,\u201d the young hunter answered. \u201cI have a respect for you, but if you were alone in this business I\u2019d think twice before I put my head into such a hornet\u2019s nest. It\u2019s Lucy that brings me here, and before harm comes on her I guess there will be one less o\u2019 the Hope family in Utah. \u201d \u201cWhat are we to do? \u201d \u201cTo-morrow is your last day, and unless you act to-night you are lost. I have a mule and two horses waiting in the Eagle Ravine. How much money have you? \u201d \u201cTwo thousand dollars in gold, and five in notes. \u201d \u201cThat will do. I have as much more to add to it. We must push for Carson City through the mountains. You had best wake Lucy. It is as well that the servants do not sleep in the house. \u201d While Ferrier was absent, preparing his daughter for the approaching journey, Jefferson Hope packed all the eatables that he could find into a small parcel, and filled a stoneware jar with water, for he knew by experience that the mountain wells were few and far between. He had hardly completed his arrangements before the farmer returned with his daughter all dressed and ready for a start. The greeting between the lovers was warm, but brief, for minutes were precious, and there was much to be done. \u201cWe must make our start at once,\u201d said Jefferson Hope, speaking in a low but resolute voice, like one who realizes the greatness of the peril, but has steeled his heart to meet it. \u201cThe front and back entrances are watched, but with caution we may get away through the side window and across the fields. Once on the road we are only two miles from the Ravine where the horses are waiting. By daybreak we should be half-way through the mountains. \u201d \u201cWhat if we are stopped,\u201d asked Ferrier.

All looked so peaceful and happy, the rustling trees and the broad silent stretch of grain-land, that it was difficult to realize that the spirit of murder lurked through it all. Yet the white face and set expression of the young hunter showed that in his approach to the house he had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head. Ferrier carried the bag of gold and notes, Jefferson Hope had the scanty provisions and water, while Lucy had a small bundle containing a few of her more valued possessions. Opening the window very slowly and carefully, they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the night, and then one by one passed through into the little garden. With bated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it, and gained the shelter of the hedge, which they skirted until they came to the gap which opened into the cornfields. They had just reached this point when the young man seized his two companions and dragged them down into the shadow, where they lay silent and trembling. It was as well that his prairie training had given Jefferson Hope the ears of a lynx. He and his friends had hardly crouched down before the melancholy hooting of a mountain owl was heard within a few yards of them, which was immediately answered by another hoot at a small distance. At the same moment a vague shadowy figure emerged from the gap for which they had been making, and uttered the plaintive signal cry again, on which a second man appeared out of the obscurity. \u201cTo-morrow at midnight,\u201d said the first who appeared to be in authority. \u201cWhen the Whip-poor-Will calls three times. \u201d \u201cIt is well,\u201d returned the other. \u201cShall I tell Brother Drebber? \u201d \u201cPass it on to him, and from him to the others. Nine to seven! \u201d \u201cSeven to five! \u201d repeated the other, and the two figures flitted away in different directions. Their concluding words had evidently been some form of sign and countersign. The instant that their footsteps had died away in the distance, Jefferson Hope sprang to his feet, and helping his companions through the gap, led the way across the fields at the top of his speed, supporting and half-carrying the girl when her strength appeared to fail her. \u201cHurry on! hurry on! \u201d he gasped from time to time. \u201cWe are through the line of sentinels. Everything depends on speed. Hurry on! \u201d Once on the high road they made rapid progress. Only once did they meet anyone, and then they managed to slip into a field, and so avoid recognition. Before reaching the town the hunter branched away into a rugged and narrow footpath which led to the mountains. Two dark jagged peaks loomed above them through the darkness, and the defile which led between them was the Eagle Ca\u00f1on in which the horses were awaiting them. With unerring instinct Jefferson Hope picked his way among the great boulders and along the bed of a dried-up watercourse, until he came to the retired corner, screened with rocks, where the faithful animals had been picketed. The girl was placed upon the mule, and old Ferrier upon one of the horses, with his money-bag, while Jefferson Hope led the other along the precipitous and dangerous path. It was a bewildering route for anyone who was not accustomed to face Nature in her wildest moods. On the one side a great crag towered up a thousand feet or more, black, stern, and menacing, with long basaltic columns upon its rugged surface like the ribs of some petrified monster. On the other hand a wild chaos of boulders and debris made all advance impossible. Between the two ran the irregular track, so narrow in places that they had to travel in Indian file, and so rough that only practised riders could have traversed it at all.

They soon had a proof, however, that they were still within the jurisdiction of the Saints. They had reached the very wildest and most desolate portion of the pass when the girl gave a startled cry, and pointed upwards. On a rock which overlooked the track, showing out dark and plain against the sky, there stood a solitary sentinel. He saw them as soon as they perceived him, and his military challenge of \u201cWho goes there? \u201d rang through the silent ravine. \u201cTravellers for Nevada,\u201d said Jefferson Hope, with his hand upon the rifle which hung by his saddle. They could see the lonely watcher fingering his gun, and peering down at them as if dissatisfied at their reply. \u201cBy whose permission? \u201d he asked. \u201cThe Holy Four,\u201d answered Ferrier. His Mormon experiences had taught him that that was the highest authority to which he could refer. \u201cNine from seven,\u201d cried the sentinel. \u201cSeven from five,\u201d returned Jefferson Hope promptly, remembering the countersign which he had heard in the garden. \u201cPass, and the Lord go with you,\u201d said the voice from above. Beyond his post the path broadened out, and the horses were able to break into a trot.

More than once they lost their way, but Hope\u2019s intimate knowledge of the mountains enabled them to regain the track once more. When morning broke, a scene of marvellous though savage beauty lay before them. In every direction the great snow-capped peaks hemmed them in, peeping over each other\u2019s shoulders to the far horizon. So steep were the rocky banks on either side of them, that the larch and the pine seemed to be suspended over their heads, and to need only a gust of wind to come hurtling down upon them. Nor was the fear entirely an illusion, for the barren valley was thickly strewn with trees and boulders which had fallen in a similar manner. Even as they passed, a great rock came thundering down with a hoarse rattle which woke the echoes in the silent gorges, and startled the weary horses into a gallop. As the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon, the caps of the great mountains lit up one after the other, like lamps at a festival, until they were all ruddy and glowing. The magnificent spectacle cheered the hearts of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy. At a wild torrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and watered their horses, while they partook of a hasty breakfast. Lucy and her father would fain have rested longer, but Jefferson Hope was inexorable. \u201cThey will be upon our track by this time,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything depends upon our speed. Once safe in Carson we may rest for the remainder of our lives. \u201d During the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles, and by evening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles from their enemies. At night-time they chose the base of a beetling crag, where the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind, and there huddled together for warmth, they enjoyed a few hours\u2019 sleep. Before daybreak, however, they were up and on their way once more. They had seen no signs of any pursuers, and Jefferson Hope began to think that they were fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whose enmity they had incurred. He little knew how far that iron grasp could reach, or how soon it was to close upon them and crush them. About the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store of provisions began to run out.

Choosing a sheltered nook, he piled together a few dried branches and made a blazing fire, at which his companions might warm themselves, for they were now nearly five thousand feet above the sea level, and the air was bitter and keen. Having tethered the horses, and bade Lucy adieu, he threw his gun over his shoulder, and set out in search of whatever chance might throw in his way. Looking back he saw the old man and the young girl crouching over the blazing fire, while the three animals stood motionless in the back-ground. Then the intervening rocks hid them from his view. He walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another without success, though from the marks upon the bark of the trees, and other indications, he judged that there were numerous bears in the vicinity. At last, after two or three hours\u2019 fruitless search, he was thinking of turning back in despair, when casting his eyes upwards he saw a sight which sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart. On the edge of a jutting pinnacle, three or four hundred feet above him, there stood a creature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance, but armed with a pair of gigantic horns. The big-horn--for so it is called--was acting, probably, as a guardian over a flock which were invisible to the hunter; but fortunately it was heading in the opposite direction, and had not perceived him. Lying on his face, he rested his rifle upon a rock, and took a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger. The animal sprang into the air, tottered for a moment upon the edge of the precipice, and then came crashing down into the valley beneath. The creature was too unwieldy to lift, so the hunter contented himself with cutting away one haunch and part of the flank. With this trophy over his shoulder, he hastened to retrace his steps, for the evening was already drawing in. He had hardly started, however, before he realized the difficulty which faced him. In his eagerness he had wandered far past the ravines which were known to him, and it was no easy matter to pick out the path which he had taken. The valley in which he found himself divided and sub-divided into many gorges, which were so like each other that it was impossible to distinguish one from the other. He followed one for a mile or more until he came to a mountain torrent which he was sure that he had never seen before. Convinced that he had taken the wrong turn, he tried another, but with the same result. Night was coming on rapidly, and it was almost dark before he at last found himself in a defile which was familiar to him. Even then it was no easy matter to keep to the right track, for the moon had not yet risen, and the high cliffs on either side made the obscurity more profound. Weighed down with his burden, and weary from his exertions, he stumbled along, keeping up his heart by the reflection that every step brought him nearer to Lucy, and that he carried with him enough to ensure them food for the remainder of their journey. He had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left them. Even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs which bounded it. They must, he reflected, be awaiting him anxiously, for he had been absent nearly five hours. In the gladness of his heart he put his hands to his mouth and made the glen re-echo to a loud halloo as a signal that he was coming. He paused and listened for an answer. None came save his own cry, which clattered up the dreary silent ravines, and was borne back to his ears in countless repetitions. Again he shouted, even louder than before, and again no whisper came back from the friends whom he had left such a short time ago. A vague, nameless dread came over him, and he hurried onwards frantically, dropping the precious food in his agitation. When he turned the corner, he came full in sight of the spot where the fire had been lit. There was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there, but it had evidently not been tended since his departure. The same dead silence still reigned all round. With his '), NULL);

There was no living creature near the remains of the fire: animals, man, maiden, all were gone. It was only too clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during his absence--a disaster which had embraced them all, and yet had left no traces behind it. Bewildered and stunned by this blow, Jefferson Hope felt his head spin round, and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling. He was essentially a man of action, however, and speedily recovered from his temporary impotence. Seizing a half-consumed piece of wood from the smouldering fire, he blew it into a flame, and proceeded with its help to examine the little camp. The ground was all stamped down by the feet of horses, showing that a large party of mounted men had overtaken the fugitives, and the direction of their tracks proved that they had afterwards turned back to Salt Lake City. Had they carried back both of his companions with them? Jefferson Hope had almost persuaded himself that they must have done so, when his eye fell upon an object which made every nerve of his body tingle within him. A little way on one side of the camp was a low-lying heap of reddish soil, which had assuredly not been there before. There was no mistaking it for anything but a newly-dug grave. As the young hunter approached it, he perceived that a stick had been planted on it, with a sheet of paper stuck in the cleft fork of it. The inscription upon the paper was brief, but to the point: JOHN FERRIER, FORMERLY OF SALT LAKE CITY, [22] Died August 4th, 1860. The sturdy old man, whom he had left so short a time before, was gone, then, and this was all his epitaph. Jefferson Hope looked wildly round to see if there was a second grave, but there was no sign of one. Lucy had been carried back by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her original destiny, by becoming one of the harem of the Elder\u2019s son. As the young fellow realized the certainty of her fate, and his own powerlessness to prevent it, he wished that he, too, was lying with the old farmer in his last silent resting-place. Again, however, his active spirit shook off the lethargy which springs from despair. If there was nothing else left to him, he could at least devote his life to revenge. With indomitable patience and perseverance, Jefferson Hope possessed also a power of sustained vindictiveness, which he may have learned from the Indians amongst whom he had lived. As he stood by the desolate fire, he felt that the only one thing which could assuage his grief would be thorough and complete retribution, brought by his own hand upon his enemies. His strong will and untiring energy should, he determined, be devoted to that one end. With a grim, white face, he retraced his steps to where he had dropped the food, and having stirred up the smouldering fire, he cooked enough to last him for a few days. This he made up into a bundle, and, tired as he was, he set himself to walk back through the mountains upon the track of the avenging angels. For five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he had already traversed on horseback. At night he flung himself down among the rocks, and snatched a few hours of sleep; but before daybreak he was always well on his way. On the sixth day, he reached the Eagle Ca\u00f1on, from which they had commenced their ill-fated flight. Thence he could look down upon the home of the saints. Worn and exhausted, he leaned upon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent widespread city beneath him. As he looked at it, he observed that there were flags in some of the principal streets, and other signs of festivity. He was still speculating as to what this might mean when he heard the clatter of horse\u2019s hoofs, and saw a mounted man riding towards him. As he approached, he recognized him as a Mormon named Cowper, to whom he had rendered services at different times. He therefore accosted him when he got up to him, with the object of finding out what Lucy Ferrier\u2019s fate had been. \u201cI am Jefferson Hope,\u201d he said. \u201cYou remembe'), NULL);

Having, however, at last, satisfied himself as to his identity, the man\u2019s surprise changed to consternation. \u201cYou are mad to come here,\u201d he cried. \u201cIt is as much as my own life is worth to be seen talking with you. There is a warrant against you from the Holy Four for assisting the Ferriers away. \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t fear them, or their warrant,\u201d Hope said, earnestly. \u201cYou must know something of this matter, Cowper. I conjure you by everything you hold dear to answer a few questions. We have always been friends. For God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t refuse to answer me. \u201d \u201cWhat is it? \u201d the Mormon asked uneasily. \u201cBe quick. The very rocks have ears and the trees eyes. \u201d \u201cWhat has become of Lucy Ferrier? \u201d \u201cShe was married yesterday to young Drebber. Hold up, man, hold up, you have no life left in you. \u201d \u201cDon\u2019t mind me,\u201d said Hope faintly. He was white to the very lips, and had sunk down on the stone against which he had been leaning. \u201cMarried, you say? \u201d \u201cMarried yesterday--that\u2019s what those flags are for on the Endowment House. There was some words between young Drebber and young Stangerson as to which was to have her. They\u2019d both been in the party that followed them, and Stangerson had shot her father, which seemed to give him the best claim; but when they argued it out in council, Drebber\u2019s party was the stronger, so the Prophet gave her over to him. No one won\u2019t have her very long though, for I saw death in her face yesterday. She is more like a ghost than a woman. Are you off, then? \u201d \u201cYes, I am off,\u201d said Jefferson Hope, who had risen from his seat. His face might have been chiselled out of marble, so hard and set was its expression, while its eyes glowed with a baleful light. \u201cWhere are you going? \u201d \u201cNever mind,\u201d he answered; and, slinging his weapon over his shoulder, strode off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the mountains to the haunts of the wild beasts. Amongst them all there was none so fierce and so dangerous as himself. The prediction of the Mormon was only too well fulfilled. Whether it was the terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful marriage into which she had been forced, poor Lucy never held up her head again, but pined away and died within a month. Her sottish husband, who had married her principally for the sake of John Ferrier\u2019s property, did not affect any great grief at his bereavement; but his other wives mourned over her, and sat up with her the night before the burial, as is the Mormon custom. They were grouped round the bier in the early hours of the morning, when, to their inexpressible fear and astonishment, the door was flung open, and a savage-looking, weather-beaten man in tattered garments strode into the room. Without a glance or a word to the cowering women, he walked up to the white silent figure which had once contained the pure soul of Lucy Ferrier. Stooping over her, he pressed his lips reverently to her cold forehead, and then, snatching up her hand, he took the wedding-ring from her finger. \u201cShe shall not be buried in that,\u201d he cried with a fierce snarl, and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the stairs and was gone. So strange and so brief was the episode, that the watchers might have found it hard to believe it themselves or persuade other people of it, had it not been for the undeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as having been a bride had disappeared. For some months Jefferson Hope lingered among the mountains, leading a strange wild life, and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for vengeance which possessed him. Tales were told in the City of the weird figure which was seen prowling about the suburbs, and which haunted the lonely mountain gorges. Once a bullet whistled through Stangerson\u2019s window and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot of him. On another occasion, as Drebber passed under a cliff a great boul'), NULL);

The two young Mormons were not long in discovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives, and led repeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or killing their enemy, but always without success. Then they adopted the precaution of never going out alone or after nightfall, and of having their houses guarded. After a time they were able to relax these measures, for nothing was either heard or seen of their opponent, and they hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness. Far from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented it. The hunter\u2019s mind was of a hard, unyielding nature, and the predominant idea of revenge had taken such complete possession of it that there was no room for any other emotion. He was, however, above all things practical. He soon realized that even his iron constitution could not stand the incessant strain which he was putting upon it. Exposure and want of wholesome food were wearing him out. If he died like a dog among the mountains, what was to become of his revenge then? And yet such a death was sure to overtake him if he persisted. He felt that that was to play his enemy\u2019s game, so he reluctantly returned to the old Nevada mines, there to recruit his health and to amass money enough to allow him to pursue his object without privation. His intention had been to be absent a year at the most, but a combination of unforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the mines for nearly five. At the end of that time, however, his memory of his wrongs and his craving for revenge were quite as keen as on that memorable night when he had stood by John Ferrier\u2019s grave. Disguised, and under an assumed name, he returned to Salt Lake City, careless what became of his own life, as long as he obtained what he knew to be justice. There he found evil tidings awaiting him. There had been a schism among the Chosen People a few months before, some of the younger members of the Church having rebelled against the authority of the Elders, and the result had been the secession of a certain number of the malcontents, who had left Utah and become Gentiles. Among these had been Drebber and Stangerson; and no one knew whither they had gone. Rumour reported that Drebber had managed to convert a large part of his property into money, and that he had departed a wealthy man, while his companion, Stangerson, was comparatively poor. There was no clue at all, however, as to their whereabouts. Many a man, however vindictive, would have abandoned all thought of revenge in the face of such a difficulty, but Jefferson Hope never faltered for a moment. With the small competence he possessed, eked out by such employment as he could pick up, he travelled from town to town through the United States in quest of his enemies. Year passed into year, his black hair turned grizzled, but still he wandered on, a human bloodhound, with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon which he had devoted his life. At last his perseverance was rewarded. It was but a glance of a face in a window, but that one glance told him that Cleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit of. He returned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance all arranged. It chanced, however, that Drebber, looking from his window, had recognized the vagrant in the street, and had read murder in his eyes. He hurried before a justice of the peace, accompanied by Stangerson, who had become his private secretary, and represented to him that they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and hatred of an old rival. That evening Jefferson Hope was taken into custody, and not being able to find sureties, was detained for some weeks. When at last he was liberated, it was only to find that Drebber\u2019s house was deserted, and that he and his secretary had departed for Europe.

At last, having collected enough to keep life in him, he departed for Europe, and tracked his enemies from city to city, working his way in any menial capacity, but never overtaking the fugitives. When he reached St. Petersburg they had departed for Paris; and when he followed them there he learned that they had just set off for Copenhagen. At the Danish capital he was again a few days late, for they had journeyed on to London, where he at last succeeded in running them to earth. As to what occurred there, we cannot do better than quote the old hunter\u2019s own account, as duly recorded in Dr. Watson\u2019s Journal, to which we are already under such obligations.</Body>\n        </Block>\n    </Chapter>\n    <Chapter id=\"12\" title=\"CHAPTER VI A CONTINUATION OF THE REMINISCENCES OF JOHN WATSON, M.D.\">\n        <Block>\n            <Body>OUR prisoner\u2019s furious resistance did not apparently indicate any ferocity in his disposition towards ourselves, for on finding himself powerless, he smiled in an affable manner, and expressed his hopes that he had not hurt any of us in the scuffle. \u201cI guess you\u2019re going to take me to the police-station,\u201d he remarked to Sherlock Holmes. \u201cMy cab\u2019s at the door.

I remember that I thought to myself, as I eyed him, that I had seldom seen a more powerfully built man; and his dark sunburned face bore an expression of determination and energy which was as formidable as his personal strength. \u201cIf there\u2019s a vacant place for a chief of the police, I reckon you are the man for it,\u201d he said, gazing with undisguised admiration at my fellow-lodger. \u201cThe way you kept on my trail was a caution. \u201d \u201cYou had better come with me,\u201d said Holmes to the two detectives. \u201cI can drive you,\u201d said Lestrade. \u201cGood! and Gregson can come inside with me. You too, Doctor, you have taken an interest in the case and may as well stick to us. \u201d I assented gladly, and we all descended together. Our prisoner made no attempt at escape, but stepped calmly into the cab which had been his, and we followed him. Lestrade mounted the box, whipped up the horse, and brought us in a very short time to our destination. We were ushered into a small chamber where a police Inspector noted down our prisoner\u2019s name and the names of the men with whose murder he had been charged. The official was a white-faced unemotional man, who went through his duties in a dull mechanical way. \u201cThe prisoner will be put before the magistrates in the course of the week,\u201d he said; \u201cin the mean time, Mr. Jefferson Hope, have you anything that you wish to say?

I did so; and became at once conscious of an extraordinary throbbing and commotion which was going on inside. The walls of his chest seemed to thrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside when some powerful engine was at work.

She was forced into marrying that same Drebber, and broke her heart over it. I took the marriage ring from her dead finger, and I vowed that his dying eyes should rest upon that very ring, and that his last thoughts should be of the crime for which he was punished. I have carried it about with me, and have followed him and his accomplice over two continents until I caught them. They thought to tire me out, but they could not do it. If I die to-morrow, as is likely enough, I die knowing that my work in this world is done, and well done. They have perished, and by my hand. There is nothing left for me to hope for, or to desire. \u201cThey were rich and I was poor, so that it was no easy matter for me to follow them. When I got to London my pocket was about empty, and I found that I must turn my hand to something for my living. Driving and riding are as natural to me as walking, so I applied at a cabowner\u2019s office, and soon got employment. I was to bring a certain sum a week to the owner, and whatever was over that I might keep for myself. There was seldom much over, but I managed to scrape along somehow. The hardest job was to learn my way about, for I reckon that of all the mazes that ever were contrived, this city is the most confusing. I had a map beside me though, and when once I had spotted the principal hotels and stations, I got on pretty well. \u201cIt was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were living; but I inquired and inquired until at last I dropped across them. They were at a boarding-house at Camberwell, over on the other side of the river. When once I found them out I knew that I had them at my mercy. I had grown my beard, and there was no chance of their recognizing me. I would dog them and follow them until I saw my opportunity. I was determined that they should not escape me again. \u201cThey were very near doing it for all that. Go where they would about London, I was always at their heels. Sometimes I followed them on my cab'), NULL);

It was only early in the morning or late at night that I could earn anything, so that I began to get behind hand with my employer. I did not mind that, however, as long as I could lay my hand upon the men I wanted. \u201cThey were very cunning, though. They must have thought that there was some chance of their being followed, for they would never go out alone, and never after nightfall. During two weeks I drove behind them every day, and never once saw them separate. Drebber himself was drunk half the time, but Stangerson was not to be caught napping. I watched them late and early, but never saw the ghost of a chance; but I was not discouraged, for something told me that the hour had almost come. My only fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a little too soon and leave my work undone. \u201cAt last, one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace, as the street was called in which they boarded, when I saw a cab drive up to their door. Presently some luggage was brought out, and after a time Drebber and Stangerson followed it, and drove off. I whipped up my horse and kept within sight of them, feeling very ill at ease, for I feared that they were going to shift their quarters. At Euston Station they got out, and I left a boy to hold my horse, and followed them on to the platform. I heard them ask for the Liverpool train, and the guard answer that one had just gone and there would not be another for some hours. Stangerson seemed to be put out at that, but Drebber was rather pleased than otherwise. I got so close to them in the bustle that I could hear every word that passed between them. Drebber said that he had a little business of his own to do, and that if the other would wait for him he would soon rejoin him. His companion remonstrated with him, and reminded him that they had resolved to stick together. Drebber answered that the matter was a delicate one, and that he must go alone. I could not catch what Stangerson said to that, but the other burst out swearing, and reminded him that he was nothing more than his paid servant, and that he must not presume to dictate to him. On that the Secretary gave it up as a bad job, and simply bargained with him that if he missed the last train he should rejoin him at Halliday\u2019s Private Hotel; to which Drebber answered that he would be back on the platform before eleven, and made his way out of the station. \u201cThe moment for which I had waited so long had at last come. I had my enemies within my power. Together they could protect each other, but singly they were at my mercy. I did not act, however, with undue precipitation. My plans were already formed. There is no satisfaction in vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that strikes him, and why retribution has come upon him. I had my plans arranged by which I should have the opportunity of making the man who had wronged me understand that his old sin had found him out. It chanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in looking over some houses in the Brixton Road had dropped the key of one of them in my carriage. It was claimed that same evening, and returned; but in the interval I had taken a moulding of it, and had a duplicate constructed. By means of this I had access to at least one spot in this great city where I could rely upon being free from interruption. How to get Drebber to that house was the difficult problem which I had now to solve. \u201cHe walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops, staying for nearly half-an-hour in the last of them. When he came out he staggered in his walk, and was evidently pretty well on. There was a hansom just in front of me, and he hailed it. I followed it so close that the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the whole way. We rattled across Waterloo Bridge and through miles of streets, until, to my astonishment, we found ourselves back in the Terrace in which he had boarded.

My mouth gets dry with the talking. \u201d I handed him the glass, and he drank it down. \u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I waited for a quarter of an hour, or more, when suddenly there came a noise like people struggling inside the house. Next moment the door was flung open and two men appeared, one of whom was Drebber, and the other was a young chap whom I had never seen before. This fellow had Drebber by the collar, and when they came to the head of the steps he gave him a shove and a kick which sent him half across the road. \u2018You hound,\u2019 he cried, shaking his stick at him; \u2018I\u2019ll teach you to insult an honest girl! \u2019 He was so hot that I think he would have thrashed Drebber with his cudgel, only that the cur staggered away down the road as fast as his legs would carry him. He ran as far as the corner, and then, seeing my cab, he hailed me and jumped in. \u2018Drive me to Halliday\u2019s Private Hotel,\u2019 said he. \u201cWhen I had him fairly inside my cab, my heart jumped so with joy that I feared lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong. I drove along slowly, weighing in my own mind what it was best to do. I might take him right out into the country, and there in some deserted lane have my last interview with him. I had almost decided upon this, when he solved the problem for me. The craze for drink had seized him again, and he ordered me to pull up outside a gin palace. He went in, leaving word that I should wait for him. There he remained until closing time, and when he came out he was so far gone that I knew the game was in my own hands. \u201cDon\u2019t imagine that I intended to kill him in cold blood. It would only have been rigid justice if I had done so, but I could not bring myself to do it. I had long determined that he should have a show for his life if he chose to take advantage of it. Among the many billets which I have filled in America during my wandering life, I was once janitor and sweeper out of the laboratory at York College. One day the professor was lecturing on poisions, [25] and he showed his students some alkaloid, as he called it, which he had extracted from some South American arrow poison, and which was so powerful that the least grain meant instant death. I spotted the bottle in which this preparation was kept, and when they were all gone, I helped myself to a little of it. I was a fairly good dispenser, so I worked this alkaloid into small, soluble pills, and each pill I put in a box with a similar pill made without the poison. I determined at the time that when I had my chance, my gentlemen should each have a draw out of one of these boxes, while I ate the pill that remained. It would be quite as deadly, and a good deal less noisy than firing across a handkerchief. From that day I had always my pill boxes about with me, and the time had now come when I was to use them. \u201cIt was nearer one than twelve, and a wild, bleak night, blowing hard and raining in torrents. Dismal as it was outside, I was glad within--so glad that I could have shouted out from pure exultation. If any of you gentlemen have ever pined for a thing, and longed for it during twenty long years, and then suddenly found it within your reach, you would understand my feelings. I lit a cigar, and puffed at it to steady my nerves, but my hands were trembling, and my temples throbbing with excitement. As I drove, I could see old John Ferrier and sweet Lucy looking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me, just as plain as I see you all in this room. All the way they were ahead of me, one on each side of the horse until I pulled up at the house in the Brixton Road. \u201cThere was not a soul to be seen, nor a sound to be heard, except the dripping of the rain. When I looked in at the window, I found Drebber all huddled together in a drunken sleep. I shook him by the arm, \u2018It\u2019s time to get out,\u2019 I said. \u201c\u2018All right, cabby,\u2019 said he. \u201cI suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had men'), NULL);

I had to walk beside him to keep him steady, for he was still a little top-heavy. When we came to the door, I opened it, and led him into the front room. I give you my word that all the way, the father and the daughter were walking in front of us. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s infernally dark,\u2019 said he, stamping about. \u201c\u2018We\u2019ll soon have a light,\u2019 I said, striking a match and putting it to a wax candle which I had brought with me. \u2018Now, Enoch Drebber,\u2019 I continued, turning to him, and holding the light to my own face, \u2018who am I? \u2019 \u201cHe gazed at me with bleared, drunken eyes for a moment, and then I saw a horror spring up in them, and convulse his whole features, which showed me that he knew me. He staggered back with a livid face, and I saw the perspiration break out upon his brow, while his teeth chattered in his head. At the sight, I leaned my back against the door and laughed loud and long. I had always known that vengeance would be sweet, but I had never hoped for the contentment of soul which now possessed me. \u201c\u2018You dog! \u2019 I said; \u2018I have hunted you from Salt Lake City to St. Petersburg, and you have always escaped me. Now, at last your wanderings have come to an end, for either you or I shall never see to-morrow\u2019s sun rise. \u2019 He shrunk still further away as I spoke, and I could see on his face that he thought I was mad. So I was for the time. The pulses in my temples beat like sledge-hammers, and I believe I would have had a fit of some sort if the blood had not gushed from my nose and relieved me. \u201c\u2018What do you think of Lucy Ferrier now? \u2019 I cried, locking the door, and shaking the key in his face. \u2018Punishment has been slow in coming, but it has overtaken you at last. \u2019 I saw his coward lips tremble as I spoke. He would have begged for his life, but he knew well that it was useless. \u201c\u2018Would you murder me? \u2019 he stammered. \u201c\u2018There is no murder,\u2019 I answered. \u2018Who talks of murdering a mad dog? What mercy had you upon my poor darling, when you dragged her from her slaughtered father, and bore her away to your accursed and shameless harem. \u2019 \u201c\u2018It was not I who killed her father,\u2019 he cried. \u201c\u2018But it was you who broke her innocent heart,\u2019 I shrieked, thrusting the box before him. \u2018Let the high God judge between us. Choose and eat. There is death in one and life in the other. I shall take what you leave. Let us see if there is justice upon the earth, or if we are ruled by chance. \u2019 \u201cHe cowered away with wild cries and prayers for mercy, but I drew my knife and held it to his throat until he had obeyed me. Then I swallowed the other, and we stood facing one another in silence for a minute or more, waiting to see which was to live and which was to die. Shall I ever forget the look which came over his face when the first warning pangs told him that the poison was in his system? I laughed as I saw it, and held Lucy\u2019s marriage ring in front of his eyes. It was but for a moment, for the action of the alkaloid is rapid. A spasm of pain contorted his features; he threw his hands out in front of him, staggered, and then, with a hoarse cry, fell heavily upon the floor. I turned him over with my foot, and placed my hand upon his heart. There was no movement. He was dead! \u201cThe blood had been streaming from my nose, but I had taken no notice of it. I don\u2019t know what it was that put it into my head to write upon the wall with it. Perhaps it was some mischievous idea of setting the police upon a wrong track, for I felt light-hearted and cheerful. I remembered a German being found in New York with RACHE written up above him, and it was argued at the time in the newspapers that the secret societies must have done it. I guessed that what puzzled the New Yorkers would puzzle the Londoners, so I dipped my finger in my own blood and printed it on a convenient place on the wall. Then I walked down to my cab and found that there was nobody about, and that the night was still very wild. I had driven some distance when I put my hand into the pocket in which I usually kept Lucy\u2019s ring, and found '), NULL);

Thinking that I might have dropped it when I stooped over Drebber\u2019s body, I drove back, and leaving my cab in a side street, I went boldly up to the house--for I was ready to dare anything rather than lose the ring. When I arrived there, I walked right into the arms of a police-officer who was coming out, and only managed to disarm his suspicions by pretending to be hopelessly drunk. \u201cThat was how Enoch Drebber came to his end. All I had to do then was to do as much for Stangerson, and so pay off John Ferrier\u2019s debt. I knew that he was staying at Halliday\u2019s Private Hotel, and I hung about all day, but he never came out. [26] fancy that he suspected something when Drebber failed to put in an appearance. He was cunning, was Stangerson, and always on his guard. If he thought he could keep me off by staying indoors he was very much mistaken. I soon found out which was the window of his bedroom, and early next morning I took advantage of some ladders which were lying in the lane behind the hotel, and so made my way into his room in the grey of the dawn. I woke him up and told him that the hour had come when he was to answer for the life he had taken so long before. I described Drebber\u2019s death to him, and I gave him the same choice of the poisoned pills. Instead of grasping at the chance of safety which that offered him, he sprang from his bed and flew at my throat. In self-defence I stabbed him to the heart. It would have been the same in any case, for Providence would never have allowed his guilty hand to pick out anything but the poison. \u201cI have little more to say, and it\u2019s as well, for I am about done up. I went on cabbing it for a day or so, intending to keep at it until I could save enough to take me back to America. I was standing in the yard when a ragged youngster asked if there was a cabby there called Jefferson Hope, and said that his cab was wanted by a gentleman at 221B, Baker Street. I went round, suspecting no harm, and the next thing I knew, this young man here had the bracelets on my wrists, and as neatly snackled [27] as ever I saw in my life. That\u2019s the whole of my story, gentlemen. You may consider me to be a murderer; but I hold that I am just as much an officer of justice as you are. \u201d So thrilling had the man\u2019s narrative been, and his manner was so impressive that we had sat silent and absorbed. Even the professional detectives, _blas\u00e9_ as they were in every detail of crime, appeared to be keenly interested in the man\u2019s story. When he finished we sat for some minutes in a stillness which was only broken by the scratching of Lestrade\u2019s pencil as he gave the finishing touches to his shorthand account. \u201cThere is only one point on which I should like a little more information,\u201d Sherlock Holmes said at last. \u201cWho was your accomplice who came for the ring which I advertised? \u201d The prisoner winked at my friend jocosely. \u201cI can tell my own secrets,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t get other people into trouble.

On the very night after his capture the aneurism burst, and he was found in the morning stretched upon the floor of the cell, with a placid smile upon his face, as though he had been able in his dying moments to look back upon a useful life, and on work well done. \u201cGregson and Lestrade will be wild about his death,\u201d Holmes remarked, as we chatted it over next evening. \u201cWhere will their grand advertisement be now? \u201d \u201cI don\u2019t see that they had very much to do with his capture,\u201d I answered. \u201cWhat you do in this world is a matter of no consequence,\u201d returned my companion, bitterly. \u201cThe question is, what can you make people believe that you have done. Never mind,\u201d he continued, more brightly, after a pause. \u201cI would not have missed the investigation for anything. There has been no better case within my recollection. Simple as it was, there were several most instructive points about it. \u201d \u201cSimple! \u201d I ejaculated. \u201cWell, really, it can hardly be described as otherwise,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, smiling at my surprise. \u201cThe proof of its intrinsic simplicity is, that without any help save a few very ordinary deductions I was able to lay my hand upon the criminal within three days. \u201d \u201cThat is true,\u201d said I. \u201cI have already explained to you that what is out of the common is usually a guide rather than a hindrance. In solving a problem of this sort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backwards. That is a very useful accomplishment, and a very easy one, but people do not practise it much. In the every-day affairs of life it is more useful to reason forwards, and so the other comes to be neglected. There are fifty who can reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically. \u201d \u201cI confess,\u201d said I, \u201cthat I do not quite follow you. \u201d \u201cI hardly expected that you would. Let me see if I can make it clearer. Most people, if you describe a train of events to them, will tell you what the result would be. They can put those events together in their minds, and argue from them that something will come to pass. There are few people, however, who, if you told them a result, would be able to evolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led up to that result. This power is what I mean when I talk of reasoning backwards, or analytically. \u201d \u201cI understand,\u201d said I. \u201cNow this was a case in which you were given the result and had to find everything else for yourself. Now let me endeavour to show you the different steps in my reasoning. To begin at the beginning. I approached the house, as you know, on foot, and with my mind entirely free from all impressions. I naturally began by examining the roadway, and there, as I have already explained to you, I saw clearly the marks of a cab, which, I ascertained by inquiry, must have been there during the night. I satisfied myself that it was a cab and not a private carriage by the narrow gauge of the wheels. The ordinary London growler is considerably less wide than a gentleman\u2019s brougham. \u201cThis was the first point gained. I then walked slowly down the garden path, which happened to be composed of a clay soil, peculiarly suitable for taking impressions. No doubt it appeared to you to be a mere trampled line of slush, but to my trained eyes every mark upon its surface had a meaning. There is no branch of detective science which is so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps. Happily, I have always laid great stress upon it, and much practice has made it second nature to me. I saw the heavy footmarks of the constables, but I saw also the track of the two men who had first passed through the garden. It was easy to tell that they had been before the others, because in places their marks had been entirely obliterated by the others coming upon the top of them. In this way my second link was formed, which told me that the nocturnal visitors were two in number, one remarkable for his height (as I calculated from the length of his stride), and the other fashionably dressed, to judge from the small and elegant impression left by his boots. \u201c'), NULL);
INSERT INTO SYSTEM_LOB_STREAM VALUES(1, 53, STRINGDECODE('On entering the house this last inference was confirmed. My well-booted man lay before me. The tall one, then, had done the murder, if murder there was. There was no wound upon the dead man\u2019s person, but the agitated expression upon his face assured me that he had foreseen his fate before it came upon him. Men who die from heart disease, or any sudden natural cause, never by any chance exhibit agitation upon their features. Having sniffed the dead man\u2019s lips I detected a slightly sour smell, and I came to the conclusion that he had had poison forced upon him. Again, I argued that it had been forced upon him from the hatred and fear expressed upon his face. By the method of exclusion, I had arrived at this result, for no other hypothesis would meet the facts. Do not imagine that it was a very unheard of idea. The forcible administration of poison is by no means a new thing in criminal annals. The cases of Dolsky in Odessa, and of Leturier in Montpellier, will occur at once to any toxicologist. \u201cAnd now came the great question as to the reason why. Robbery had not been the object of the murder, for nothing was taken. Was it politics, then, or was it a woman? That was the question which confronted me. I was inclined from the first to the latter supposition. Political assassins are only too glad to do their work and to fly. This murder had, on the contrary, been done most deliberately, and the perpetrator had left his tracks all over the room, showing that he had been there all the time. It must have been a private wrong, and not a political one, which called for such a methodical revenge. When the inscription was discovered upon the wall I was more inclined than ever to my opinion. The thing was too evidently a blind. When the ring was found, however, it settled the question. Clearly the murderer had used it to remind his victim of some dead or absent woman. It was at this point that I asked Gregson whether he had enquired in his telegram to Cleveland as to any particular point in Mr. Drebber\u2019s former career. He answered, you remember, in the negative. \u201cI then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room, which confirmed me in my opinion as to the murderer\u2019s height, and furnished me with the additional details as to the Trichinopoly cigar and the length of his nails. I had already come to the conclusion, since there were no signs of a struggle, that the blood which covered the floor had burst from the murderer\u2019s nose in his excitement. I could perceive that the track of blood coincided with the track of his feet. It is seldom that any man, unless he is very full-blooded, breaks out in this way through emotion, so I hazarded the opinion that the criminal was probably a robust and ruddy-faced man. Events proved that I had judged correctly. \u201cHaving left the house, I proceeded to do what Gregson had neglected. I telegraphed to the head of the police at Cleveland, limiting my enquiry to the circumstances connected with the marriage of Enoch Drebber. The answer was conclusive. It told me that Drebber had already applied for the protection of the law against an old rival in love, named Jefferson Hope, and that this same Hope was at present in Europe. I knew now that I held the clue to the mystery in my hand, and all that remained was to secure the murderer. \u201cI had already determined in my own mind that the man who had walked into the house with Drebber, was none other than the man who had driven the cab. The marks in the road showed me that the horse had wandered on in a way which would have been impossible had there been anyone in charge of it. Where, then, could the driver be, unless he were inside the house? Again, it is absurd to suppose that any sane man would carry out a deliberate crime under the very eyes, as it were, of a third person, who was sure to betray him. Lastly, supposing one man wished to dog another through London, what better means could he adopt than to turn cabdriver. All these considerations led me to the irresistible conclusion that Jefferson Hope was to be found among the jarveys of the Metropolis.'), NULL);

On the contrary, from his point of view, any sudden change would be likely to draw attention to himself. He would, probably, for a time at least, continue to perform his duties. There was no reason to suppose that he was going under an assumed name. Why should he change his name in a country where no one knew his original one? I therefore organized my Street Arab detective corps, and sent them systematically to every cab proprietor in London until they ferreted out the man that I wanted. How well they succeeded, and how quickly I took advantage of it, are still fresh in your recollection. The murder of Stangerson was an incident which was entirely unexpected, but which could hardly in any case have been prevented. Through it, as you know, I came into possession of the pills, the existence of which I had already surmised.

The details of the case will probably be never known now, though we are informed upon good authority that the crime was the result of an old standing and romantic feud, in which love and Mormonism bore a part. It seems that both the victims belonged, in their younger days, to the Latter Day Saints, and Hope, the deceased prisoner, hails also from Salt Lake City. If the case has had no other effect, it, at least, brings out in the most striking manner the efficiency of our detective police force, and will serve as a lesson to all foreigners that they will do wisely to settle their feuds at home, and not to carry them on to British soil. It is an open secret that the credit of this smart capture belongs entirely to the well-known Scotland Yard officials, Messrs. Lestrade and Gregson. The man was apprehended, it appears, in the rooms of a certain Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who has himself, as an amateur, shown some talent in the detective line, and who, with such instructors, may hope in time to attain to some degree of their skill. It is expected that a testimonial of some sort will be presented to the two officers as a fitting recognition of their services. \u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you so when we started? \u201d cried Sherlock Holmes with a laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s the result of all our Study in Scarlet: to get them a testimonial! \u201d \u201cNever mind,\u201d I answered, \u201cI have all the facts in my journal, and the public shall know them. In the meantime you must make yourself contented by the consciousness of success, like the Roman miser-- \u201c\u2018Populus me sibilat, at mihi plaudo Ipse domi simul ac nummos contemplor in arca. \u2019\u201d</Body>\n        </Block>\n    </Chapter>\n</Book>\n'), NULL);

They consisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large airy sitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad windows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so moderate did the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain was concluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession. That very evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the following morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and portmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and laying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new surroundings. Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet in his ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be up after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and occasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the City. Nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize him, and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"1#2\" wordCount=\"273\" sentimentScore=\"-0.3276\" fkGrade=\"13.657313868613137\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.004456204379562044\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.007700729927007299\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.009288321167883211\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.007733576642335767\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.0127992700729927\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.01202919708029197\"/>\n            <Body>On these occasions '), NULL);

As the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his aims in life, gradually deepened and increased. His very person and appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual observer. In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively lean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp and piercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have alluded; and his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air of alertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and squareness which mark the man of determination. His hands were invariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was possessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had occasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments. The reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how much this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured to break through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned himself. Before pronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered, how objectless was my life, and how little there was to engage my attention.

He was not studying medicine. He had himself, in reply to a question, confirmed Stamford\u2019s opinion upon that point. Neither did he appear to have pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in science or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance into the learned world. Yet his zeal for certain studies was remarkable, and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ample and minute that his observations have fairly astounded me. Surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise information unless he had some definite end in view. Desultory readers are seldom remarkable for the exactness of their learning. No man burdens his mind with small matters unless he has some very good reason for doing so. His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporary literature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing. Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired in the naivest way who he might be and what he had done. My surprise reached a climax, however, when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the Copernican Theory and of the composition of the Solar System. That any civilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an extraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"1#4\" wordCount=\"262\" sentimentScore=\"-0.34933333333333333\" fkGrade=\"7.5752684824902765\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.010577358490566038\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.0041320754716981135\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.0051471698113207546\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"su'), NULL);

Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent.

Therefore all the knowledge which he possessed was such as would be useful to him. I enumerated in my own mind all the various points upon which he had shown me that he was exceptionally well-informed. I even took a pencil and jotted them down.

These were very remarkable, but as eccentric as all his other accomplishments. That he could play pieces, and difficult pieces, I knew well, because at my request he has played me some of Mendelssohn\u2019s Lieder, and other favourites. When left to himself, however, he would seldom produce any music or attempt any recognized air. Leaning back in his arm-chair of an evening, he would close his eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his knee. Sometimes the chords were sonorous and melancholy. Occasionally they were fantastic and cheerful. Clearly they reflected the thoughts which possessed him, but whether the music aided those thoughts, or whether the playing was simply the result of a whim or fancy was more than I could determine. I might have rebelled against these exasperating solos had it not been that he usually terminated them by playing in quick succession a whole series of my favourite airs as a slight compensation for the trial upon my patience. During the first week or so we had no callers, and I had begun to think that my companion was as friendless a man as I was myself.

The same afternoon brought a grey-headed, seedy visitor, looking like a Jew pedlar, who appeared to me to be much excited, and who was closely followed by a slip-shod elderly woman. On another occasion an old white-haired gentleman had an interview with my companion; and on another a railway porter in his velveteen uniform. When any of these nondescript individuals put in an appearance, Sherlock Holmes used to beg for the use of the sitting-room, and I would retire to my bed-room.

It struck me as being a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. The reasoning was close and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to be far-fetched and exaggerated. The writer claimed by a momentary expression, a twitch of a muscle or a glance of an eye, to fathom a man\u2019s inmost thoughts. Deceit, according to him, was an impossibility in the case of one trained to observation and analysis. His conclusions were as infallible as so many propositions of Euclid. So startling would his results appear to the uninitiated that until they learned the processes by which he had arrived at them they might well consider him as a necromancer. \u201cFrom a drop of water,\u201d said the writer, \u201ca logician could infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of one or the other.

When these fellows are at fault they come to me, and I manage to put them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence before me, and I am generally able, by the help of my knowledge of the history of crime, to set them straight. There is a strong family resemblance about misdeeds, and if you have all the details of a thousand at your finger ends, it is odd if you can\u2019t unravel the thousand and first. Lestrade is a well-known detective. He got himself into a fog recently over a forgery case, and that was what brought him here. \u201d</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"1#11\" wordCount=\"254\" sentimentScore=\"-0.10160000000000001\" fkGrade=\"6.088793172690764\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.0054235294117647055\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.005454901960784314\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.006164705882352941\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.004749019607843137\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.01430980392156863\"/>\n            <Body>\u201cAnd these other people? \u201d \u201cThey are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies.

A small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption of sickly plants separated each of these houses from the street, and was traversed by a narrow pathway, yellowish in colour, and consisting apparently of a mixture of clay and of gravel. The whole place was very sloppy from the rain which had fallen through the night. The garden was bounded by a three-foot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the top, and against this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable, surrounded by a small knot of loafers, who craned their necks and strained their eyes in the vain hope o'), NULL);

There were many marks of footsteps upon the wet clayey soil, but since the police had been coming and going over it, I was unable to see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it. Still I had had such extraordinary evidence of the quickness of his perceptive faculties, that I had no doubt that he could see a great deal which was hidden from me.

The other belonged to the dining-room, which was the apartment in which the mysterious affair had occurred.

At present my attention was centred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon the boards, with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured ceiling. It was that of a man about forty-three or forty-four years of age, middle-sized, broad shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and a short stubbly beard. He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat and waistcoat, with light-coloured trousers, and immaculate collar and cuffs. A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floor beside him. His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while his lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been a grievous one. On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror, and as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human features. This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low forehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a singularly simious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his writhing, unnatural posture. I have seen death in many forms, but never has it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy apartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban London. Lestrade, lean and ferret-like as ever, was standing by the doorway, and greeted my companion and myself. \u201cThis case will make a stir, sir,\u201d he remarked. \u201cIt beats anything I have seen, and I am no chicken. \u201d</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"2#9\" wordCount=\"262\" sentimentScore=\"-0.20153846153846156\" fkGrade=\"4.982031250000002\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.01189513108614232\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.009157303370786516\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.009666666666666667\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.026378277153558054\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.022898876404494374\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.009973782771535579\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.013029962546816482\"/>\n            <Body>\u201cThere is no clue? \u201d said Gregson. \u201cNone at all,\u201d chimed in Lestrade.

He came here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab, which was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his off fore leg.

Now, up to last night, we have had no rain for a week, so that those wheels which left such a deep impression must have been there during the night. There were the marks of the horse\u2019s hoofs, too, the outline of one of which was far more clearly cut than that of the other three, showing that that was a new shoe. Since the cab was there after the rain began, and was not there at any time during the morning--I have Gregson\u2019s word for that--it follows that it must have been there during the night, and, therefore, that it brought those two individuals to the house. \u201d \u201cThat seems simple enough,\u201d said I; \u201cbut how about the other man\u2019s height? \u201d</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"3#2\" wordCount=\"251\" sentimentScore=\"-0.15852631578947368\" fkGrade=\"4.9820255818829935\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.006709803921568627\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Body>\u201cWhy, the height of a man, in nine cases out of ten, can be told from the length of his stride.

After Holmes\u2019 departure for the concert, I lay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours\u2019 sleep. It was a useless attempt. My mind had been too much excited by all that had occurred, and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into it. Every time that I closed my eyes I saw before me the distorted baboon-like countenance of the murdered man. So sinister was the impression which that face had produced upon me that I found it difficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who had removed its owner from the world. If ever human features bespoke vice of the most malignant type, they were certainly those of Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland. Still I recognized that justice must be done, and that the depravity of the victim was no condonment [11] in the eyes of the law. The more I thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion\u2019s hypothesis, that the man had been poisoned, appear. I remembered how he had sniffed his lips, and had no doubt that he had detected something which had given rise to the idea. Then, again, if not poison, what had caused the man\u2019s death, since there was neither wound nor marks of strangulation? But, on the other hand, whose blood was that which lay so thickly upon the floor? There were no signs of a struggle, nor had the victim any weapon with which he might have wounded an antagonist.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"4#2\" wordCount=\"253\" sentimentScore=\"-0.1518\" fkGrade=\"6.1801470588235325\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.007253846153846153\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.012976923076923077\"/>\n      '), NULL);

He was very late in returning--so late, that I knew that the concert could not have detained him all the time. Dinner was on the table before he appeared. \u201cIt was magnificent,\u201d he said, as he took his seat. \u201cDo you remember what Darwin says about music?

Of course, Doctor Watson, this is strictly between ourselves. The first difficulty which we had to contend with was the finding of this American\u2019s antecedents. Some people would have waited until their advertisements were answered, or until parties came forward and volunteered information. That is not Tobias Gregson\u2019s way of going to work. You remember the hat beside the dead man? \u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Holmes; \u201cby John Underwood and Sons, 129, Camberwell Road. \u201d Gregson looked quite crest-fallen. \u201cI had no idea that you noticed that,\u201d he said. \u201cHave you been there? \u201d \u201cNo. \u201d \u201cHa! \u201d cried Gregson, in a relieved voice; \u201cyou should never neglect a chance, however small it may seem. \u201d \u201cTo a great mind, nothing is little,\u201d remarked Holmes, sententiously. \u201cWell, I went to Underwood, and asked him if he had sold a hat of that size and description. He looked over his books, and came on it at once. He had sent the hat to a Mr. Drebber, residing at Charpentier\u2019s Boarding Establishment, Torquay Terrace.

The window of the room was open, and beside the window, all huddled up, lay the body of a man in his nightdress. He was quite dead, and had been for some time, for his limbs were rigid and cold. When we turned him over, the Boots recognized him at once as being the same gentleman who had engaged the room under the name of Joseph Stangerson. The cause of death was a deep stab in the left side, which must have penetrated the heart. And now comes the strangest part of the affair. What do you suppose was above the murdered man? \u201d I felt a creeping of the flesh, and a presentiment of coming horror, even before Sherlock Holmes answered. \u201cThe word RACHE, written in letters of blood,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was it,\u201d said Lestrade, in an awe-struck voice; and we were all silent for a while.

Nor is Nature always in one mood throughout this grim district. It comprises snow-capped and lofty mountains, and dark and gloomy valleys. There are swift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged ca\u00f1ons; and there are enormous plains, which in winter are white with snow, and in summer are grey with the saline alkali dust. They all preserve, however, the common characteristics of barrenness, inhospitality, and misery. There are no inhabitants of this land of despair. A band of Pawnees or of Blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other hunting-grounds, but the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose sight of those awesome plains, and to find themselves once more upon their prairies. The coyote skulks among the scrub, the buzzard flaps heavily through the air, and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through the dark ravines, and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the rocks. These are the sole dwellers in the wilderness. In the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the northern slope of the Sierra Blanco.

From the shores of the Mississippi to the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains they had struggled on with a constancy almost unparalleled in history. The savage man, and the savage beast, hunger, thirst, fatigue, and disease--every impediment which Nature could place in the way, had all been overcome with Anglo-Saxon tenacity. Yet the long journey and the accumulated terrors had shaken the hearts of the stoutest among them. There was not one who did not sink upon his knees in heartfelt prayer when they saw the broad valley of Utah bathed in the sunlight beneath them, and learned from the lips of their leader that this was the promised land, and that these virgin acres were to be theirs for evermore. Young speedily proved himself to be a skilful administrator as well as a resolute chief. Maps were drawn and charts prepared, in which the future city was sketched out. All around farms were apportioned and allotted in proportion to the standing of each individual. The tradesman was put to his trade and the artisan to his calling. In the town streets and squares sprang up, as if by magic. In the country there was draining and hedging, planting and clearing, until the next summer saw the whole country golden with the wheat crop. Everything prospered in the strange settlement. Above all, the great temple which they had erected in the centre of the city grew ever taller and larger.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"8#2\" wordCount=\"250\" sentimentScore=\"0.14285714285714285\" fkGrade=\"16.150000000000002\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.013916666666666667\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.00653'), NULL);

The two castaways, John Ferrier and the little girl who had shared his fortunes and had been adopted as his daughter, accompanied the Mormons to the end of their great pilgrimage. Little Lucy Ferrier was borne along pleasantly enough in Elder Stangerson\u2019s waggon, a retreat which she shared with the Mormon\u2019s three wives and with his son, a headstrong forward boy of twelve. Having rallied, with the elasticity of childhood, from the shock caused by her mother\u2019s death, she soon became a pet with the women, and reconciled herself to this new life in her moving canvas-covered home. In the meantime Ferrier having recovered from his privations, distinguished himself as a useful guide and an indefatigable hunter. So rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new companions, that when they reached the end of their wanderings, it was unanimously agreed that he should be provided with as large and as fertile a tract of land as any of the settlers, with the exception of Young himself, and of Stangerson, Kemball, Johnston, and Drebber, who were the four principal Elders. On the farm thus acquired John Ferrier built himself a substantial log-house, which received so many additions in succeeding years that it grew into a roomy villa.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"8#3\" wordCount=\"265\" sentimentScore=\"-0.08153846153846155\" fkGrade=\"10.166296296296299\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.008346863468634686\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.004760147601476015\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.004439114391143912\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.02052767527675277\"/>\n            <Body>He was a man of a practical turn of mind, keen in his dealings and skilful with his hands. His iron constitution enabled him to work morning and evening at improving and tilling his lands. Hence it came about that his farm and all that belonged to him prospered exceedingly. In three years he was better off than his neighbours, in six he was well-to-do, in nine he was rich, and in twelve there were not half a dozen men in the whole of Salt Lake City who could compare with him. From the great inland sea to the distant Wahsatch Mountains there was no name better known than that of John Ferrier. There was one way and only one in which he offended the susceptibilities of his co-religionists. No argument or persuasion could ever induce him to set up a female establishment after the manner of his companions. He never gave reasons for this persistent refusal, but contented himself by resolutely and inflexibly adhering to his determination. There were some who accused him of lukewarmness in his adopted religion, and others who put it down to greed of wealth and reluctance to incur expense. Others, again, spoke of some early love affair, and of a fair-haired girl who had pined away on the shores of the Atlantic. Whatever the reason, Ferrier remained strictly celibate. In every other respect he conformed to the religion of the young settlement, and gained the name of being an orthodox and straight-walking man.

As year succeeded to year she grew taller and stronger, her cheek more rudy, and her step more elastic. Many a wayfarer upon the high road which ran by Ferrier\u2019s farm felt long-forgotten thoughts revive in their mind as they watched her lithe girlish figure tripping through the wheatfields, or met her mounted upon her father\u2019s mustang, and managing it with all the ease and grace of a true child of the West. So the bud blossomed into a flower, and the year which saw her father the richest of the farmers left her as fair a specimen of American girlhood as could be found in the whole Pacific slope. It was not the father, however, who first discovered that the child had developed into the woman. It seldom is in such cases. That mysterious change is too subtle and too gradual to be measured by dates. Least of all does the maiden herself know it until the tone of a voice or the touch of a hand sets her heart thrilling within her, and she learns, with a mixture of pride and of fear, that a new and a larger nature has awoken within her. There are few who cannot recall that day and remember the one little incident which heralded the dawn of a new life.

In the fields and in the streets rose the same hum of human industry. Down the dusty high roads defiled long streams of heavily-laden mules, all heading to the west, for the gold fever had broken out in California, and the Overland Route lay through the City of the Elect. There, too, were droves of sheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands, and trains of tired immigrants, men and horses equally weary of their interminable journey. Through all this motley assemblage, threading her way with the skill of an accomplished rider, there galloped Lucy Ferrier, her fair face flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut hair floating out behind her. She had a commission from her father in the City, and was dashing in as she had done many a time before, with all the fearlessness of youth, thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed. The travel-stained adventurers gazed after her in astonishment, and even the unemotional Indians, journeying in with their pelties, relaxed their accustomed stoicism as they marvelled at the beauty of the pale-faced maiden. She had reached the outskirts of the city when she found the road blocked by a great drove of cattle, driven by a half-dozen wild-looking herdsmen from the plains. In her impatience she endeavoured to pass this obstacle by pushing her horse into what appeared to be a gap.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"8#6\" wordCount=\"261\" sentimentScore=\"-0.1044\" fkGrade=\"11.895897338403046\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.021034220532319393\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.019847908745247146\"/>\n            <Emo'), NULL);

Accustomed as she was to deal with cattle, she was not alarmed at her situation, but took advantage of every opportunity to urge her horse on in the hopes of pushing her way through the cavalcade. Unfortunately the horns of one of the creatures, either by accident or design, came in violent contact with the flank of the mustang, and excited it to madness. In an instant it reared up upon its hind legs with a snort of rage, and pranced and tossed in a way that would have unseated any but a most skilful rider. The situation was full of peril. Every plunge of the excited horse brought it against the horns again, and goaded it to fresh madness. It was all that the girl could do to keep herself in the saddle, yet a slip would mean a terrible death under the hoofs of the unwieldy and terrified animals. Unaccustomed to sudden emergencies, her head began to swim, and her grip upon the bridle to relax. Choked by the rising cloud of dust and by the steam from the struggling creatures, she might have abandoned her efforts in despair, but for a kindly voice at her elbow which assured her of assistance. At the same moment a sinewy brown hand caught the frightened horse by the curb, and forcing a way through the drove, soon brought her to the outskirts.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"8#7\" wordCount=\"250\" sentimentScore=\"-0.10526315789473684\" fkGrade=\"5.377543859649123\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.014759689922480619\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.020449612403100777\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.007085271317829458\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.024472868217054265\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.015810077519379847\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.009325581395348836\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.027647286821705426\"/>\n            <Body>\u201cYou\u2019re not hurt, I hope, miss,\u201d said her preserver, respectfully.

Young Jefferson Hope rode on with his companions, gloomy and taciturn. He and they had been among the Nevada Mountains prospecting for silver, and were returning to Salt Lake City in the hope of raising capital enough to work some lodes which they had discovered. He had been as keen as any of them upon the business until this sudden incident had drawn his thoughts into another channel. The sight of the fair young girl, as frank and wholesome as the Sierra breezes, had stirred his volcanic, untamed heart to its very depths. When she had vanished from his sight, he realized that a crisis had come in his life, and that neither silver speculations nor any other questions could ever be of such importance to him as this new and all-absorbing one. The love which had sprung up in his heart was not the sudden, changeable fancy of a boy, but rather the wild, fierce passion of a man of strong will and imperious temper.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"8#9\" wordCount=\"255\" sentimentScore=\"0.15692307692307694\" fkGrade=\"8.17671875\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.01583984375\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.00532421875\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.011140625\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.0269765625\"/>\n            <Body>He had been accustomed to succeed in all that he undertook.

He called on John Ferrier that night, and many times again, until his face was a familiar one at the farm-house. John, cooped up in the valley, and absorbed in his work, had had little chance of learning the news of the outside world during the last twelve years. All this Jefferson Hope was able to tell him, and in a style which interested Lucy as well as her father. He had been a pioneer in California, and could narrate many a strange tale of fortunes made and fortunes lost in those wild, halcyon days. He had been a scout too, and a trapper, a silver explorer, and a ranchman. Wherever stirring adventures were to be had, Jefferson Hope had been there in search of them. He soon became a favourite with the old farmer, who spoke eloquently of his virtues. On such occasions, Lucy was silent, but her blushing cheek and her bright, happy eyes, showed only too clearly that her young heart was no longer her own. Her honest father may not have observed these symptoms, but they were assuredly not thrown away upon the man who had won her affections. It was a summer evening when he came galloping down the road and pulled up at the gate. She was at the doorway, and came down to meet him.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"8#10\" wordCount=\"256\" sentimentScore=\"-0.1861818181818182\" fkGrade=\"4.201042780748665\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.005467432950191571\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.011226053639846745\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.00945977011494253\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.004758620689655172\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.00446360153256705\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"'), NULL);

John Ferrier\u2019s heart was sore within him when he thought of the young man\u2019s return, and of the impending loss of his adopted child. Yet her bright and happy face reconciled him to the arrangement more than any argument could have done. He had always determined, deep down in his resolute heart, that nothing would ever induce him to allow his daughter to wed a Mormon. Such a marriage he regarded as no marriage at all, but as a shame and a disgrace. Whatever he might think of the Mormon doctrines, upon that one point he was inflexible.

A rash word or a hasty act was followed by annihilation, and yet none knew what the nature might be of this terrible power which was suspended over them. No wonder that men went about in fear and trembling, and that even in the heart of the wilderness they dared not whisper the doubts which oppressed them. At first this vague and terrible power was exercised only upon the recalcitrants who, having embraced the Mormon faith, wished afterwards to pervert or to abandon it. Soon, however, it took a wider range. The supply of adult women was running short, and polygamy without a female population on which to draw was a barren doctrine indeed. Strange rumours began to be bandied about--rumours of murdered immigrants and rifled camps in regions where Indians had never been seen. Fresh women appeared in the harems of the Elders--women who pined and wept, and bore upon their faces the traces of an unextinguishable horror. Belated wanderers upon the mountains spoke of gangs of armed men, masked, stealthy, and noiseless, who flitted by them in the darkness.

Both of them nodded to Ferrier as he entered, and the one in the rocking-chair commenced the conversation. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t know us,\u201d he said. \u201cThis here is the son of Elder Drebber, and I\u2019m Joseph Stangerson, who travelled with you in the desert when the Lord stretched out His hand and gathered you into the true fold. \u201d \u201cAs He will all the nations in His own good time,\u201d said the other in a nasal voice; \u201cHe grindeth slowly but exceeding small. \u201d John Ferrier bowed coldly.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"10#2\" wordCount=\"250\" sentimentScore=\"0.07142857142857142\" fkGrade=\"7.5814025448236\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.00524609375'), NULL);

As I have but four wives and Brother Drebber here has seven, it appears to me that my claim is the stronger one. \u201d \u201cNay, nay, Brother Stangerson,\u201d cried the other; \u201cthe question is not how many wives we have, but how many we can keep. My father has now given over his mills to me, and I am the richer man. \u201d \u201cBut my prospects are better,\u201d said the other, warmly. \u201cWhen the Lord removes my father, I shall have his tanning yard and his leather factory. Then I am your elder, and am higher in the Church. \u201d \u201cIt will be for the maiden to decide,\u201d rejoined young Drebber, smirking at his own reflection in the glass. \u201cWe will leave it all to her decision. \u201d During this dialogue, John Ferrier had stood fuming in the doorway, hardly able to keep his riding-whip from the backs of his two visitors. \u201cLook here,\u201d he said at last, striding up to them, \u201cwhen my daughter summons you, you can come, but until then I don\u2019t want to see your faces again. \u201d The two young Mormons stared at him in amazement. In their eyes this competition between them for the maiden\u2019s hand was the highest of honours both to her and her father.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"10#3\" wordCount=\"270\" sentimentScore=\"-0.1705263157894737\" fkGrade=\"5.691310786471885\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.018080000000000002\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.017865454545454545\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.004178181818181818\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.01710545454545455\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.013927272727272727\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.011421818181818182\"/>\n            <Body>\u201cThere are two ways out of the room,\u201d cried Ferrier; \u201cthere is the door, and there is the window.

The old farmer followed them to the door. \u201cLet me know when you have settled which it is to be,\u201d he said, sardonically. \u201cYou shall smart for this! \u201d Stangerson cried, white with rage. \u201cYou have defied the Prophet and the Council of Four. You shall rue it to the end of your days. \u201d \u201cThe hand of the Lord shall be heavy upon you,\u201d cried young Drebber; \u201cHe will arise and smite you! \u201d \u201cThen I\u2019ll start the smiting,\u201d exclaimed Ferrier furiously, and would have rushed upstairs for his gun had not Lucy seized him by the arm and restrained him. Before he could escape from her, the clatter of horses\u2019 hoofs told him that they were beyond his reach. \u201cThe young canting rascals! \u201d he exclaimed, wiping the perspiration from his forehead; \u201cI would sooner see you in your grave, my girl, than the wife of either of them. \u201d \u201cAnd so should I, father,\u201d she answered, with spirit; \u201cbut Jefferson will soon be here. \u201d \u201cYes. It will not be long before he comes. The sooner the better, for we do not know what their next move may be. \u201d It was, indeed, high time that someone capable of giving advice and help should come to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his adopted daughter.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"10#4\" wordCount=\"250\" sentimentScore=\"0.09090909090909091\" fkGrade=\"9.750750988142297\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.01262992125984252\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.01598818897637795\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.008425196850393701\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.025259842'), NULL);

If minor errors were punished so sternly, what would be the fate of this arch rebel. Ferrier knew that his wealth and position would be of no avail to him. Others as well known and as rich as himself had been spirited away before now, and their goods given over to the Church. He was a brave man, but he trembled at the vague, shadowy terrors which hung over him. Any known danger he could face with a firm lip, but this suspense was unnerving. He concealed his fears from his daughter, however, and affected to make light of the whole matter, though she, with the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at ease. He expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from Young as to his conduct, and he was not mistaken, though it came in an unlooked-for manner. Upon rising next morning he found, to his surprise, a small square of paper pinned on to the coverlet of his bed just over his chest. On it was printed, in bold straggling letters:-- \u201cTwenty-nine days are given you for amendment, and then----\u201d The dash was more fear-inspiring than any threat could have been. How this warning came into his room puzzled John Ferrier sorely, for his servants slept in an outhouse, and the doors and windows had all been secured.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"10#5\" wordCount=\"254\" sentimentScore=\"-0.2177142857142857\" fkGrade=\"8.264943977591042\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.01335294117647059\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.011305882352941176\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.0057568627450980394\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.020152941176470585\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.010478431372549021\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.011368627450980393\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.015654901960784312\"/>\n            <Body>He crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his daughter, but the incident struck a chill into his heart. The twenty-nine days were evidently the balance of the month which Young had promised. What strength or courage could avail against an enemy armed with such mysterious powers? The hand which fastened that pin might have struck him to the heart, and he could never have known who had slain him. Still more shaken was he next morning. They had sat down to their breakfast when Lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards. In the centre of the ceiling was scrawled, with a burned stick apparently, the number 28. To his daughter it was unintelligible, and he did not enlighten her. That night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and ward. He saw and he heard nothing, and yet in the morning a great 27 had been painted upon the outside of his door. Thus day followed day; and as sure as morning came he found that his unseen enemies had kept their register, and had marked up in some conspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the month of grace. Sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls, sometimes upon the floors, occasionally they were on small placards stuck upon the garden gate or the railings. With all his vigilance John Ferrier could not discover whence these daily warnings proceeded. A horror which was almost superstitious came upon him at the sight of them.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"10#6\" wordCount=\"251\" sentimentScore=\"-0.695076923076923\" fkGrade=\"7.950988142292491\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.022719367588932806\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.0051264822134387345\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.012656126482213438\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.01900395256916996\"/>\n            <Emotion typ'), NULL);

He had but one hope in life now, and that was for the arrival of the young hunter from Nevada. Twenty had changed to fifteen and fifteen to ten, but there was no news of the absentee. One by one the numbers dwindled down, and still there came no sign of him. Whenever a horseman clattered down the road, or a driver shouted at his team, the old farmer hurried to the gate thinking that help had arrived at last. At last, when he saw five give way to four and that again to three, he lost heart, and abandoned all hope of escape. Single-handed, and with his limited knowledge of the mountains which surrounded the settlement, he knew that he was powerless. The more-frequented roads were strictly watched and guarded, and none could pass along them without an order from the Council. Turn which way he would, there appeared to be no avoiding the blow which hung over him. Yet the old man never wavered in his resolution to part with life itself before he consented to what he regarded as his daughter\u2019s dishonour. He was sitting alone one evening pondering deeply over his troubles, and searching vainly for some way out of them. That morning had shown the figure 2 upon the wall of his house, and the next day would be the last of the allotted time.

And his daughter--what was to become of her after he was gone? Was there no escape from the invisible network which was drawn all round them. He sank his head upon the table and sobbed at the thought of his own impotence. What was that? In the silence he heard a gentle scratching sound--low, but very distinct in the quiet of the night. It came from the door of the house. Ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently. There was a pause for a few moments, and then the low insidious sound was repeated. Someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the panels of the door. Was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry out the murderous orders of the secret tribunal? Or was it some agent who was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived. John Ferrier felt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook his nerves and chilled his heart. Springing forward he drew the bolt and threw the door open. Outside all was calm and quiet. The night was fine, and the stars were twinkling brightly overhead. The little front garden lay before the farmer\u2019s eyes bounded by the fence and gate, but neither there nor on the road was any human being to be seen. With a sigh of relief, Ferrier looked to right and to left, until happening to glance straight down at his own feet he saw to his astonishment a man lying flat upon his face upon the ground, with arms and legs all asprawl.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"10#8\" wordCount=\"255\" sentimentScore=\"-0.1457142857142857\" fkGrade=\"4.411394825646795\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.00836923076923077\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.01390769230769231\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.009884615384615384\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.020626923076923077\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.008234615384615385\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n       '), NULL);

His first thought was that the prostrate figure was that of some wounded or dying man, but as he watched it he saw it writhe along the ground and into the hall with the rapidity and noiselessness of a serpent. Once within the house the man sprang to his feet, closed the door, and revealed to the astonished farmer the fierce face and resolute expression of Jefferson Hope. \u201cGood God! \u201d gasped John Ferrier. \u201cHow you scared me! Whatever made you come in like that. \u201d \u201cGive me food,\u201d the other said, hoarsely. \u201cI have had no time for bite or sup for eight-and-forty hours. \u201d He flung himself upon the [21] cold meat and bread which were still lying upon the table from his host\u2019s supper, and devoured it voraciously. \u201cDoes Lucy bear up well? \u201d he asked, when he had satisfied his hunger. \u201cYes.

He had hardly completed his arrangements before the farmer returned with his daughter all dressed and ready for a start.

He had long nerved himself to the sacrifice, however, and the thought of the honour and happiness of his daughter outweighed any regret at his ruined fortunes. All looked so peaceful and happy, the rustling trees and the broad silent stretch of grain-land, that it was difficult to realize that the spirit of murder lurked through it all. Yet the white face and set expression of the young hunter showed that in his approach to the house he had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head.

With bated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it, and gained the shelter of the hedge, which they skirted until they came to the gap which opened into the cornfields. They had just reached this point when the young man seized his two companions and dragged them down into the shadow, where they lay silent and trembling. It was as well that his prairie training had given Jefferson Hope the ears of a lynx. He and his friends had hardly crouched down before the melancholy hooting of a mountain owl was heard within a few yards of them, which was immediately answered by another hoot at a small distance. At the same moment a vague shadowy figure emerged from the gap for which they had been making, and uttered the plaintive signal cry again, on which a second man appeared out of the obscurity. \u201cTo-morrow at midnight,\u201d said the first who appeared to be in authority. \u201cWhen the Whip-poor-Will calls three times. \u201d \u201cIt is well,\u201d returned the other. \u201cShall I tell Brother Drebber? \u201d \u201cPass it on to him, and from him to the others.

Before reaching the town the hunter branched away into a rugged and narrow footpath which led to the mountains. Two dark jagged peaks loomed above them through the darkness, and the defile which led between them was the Eagle Ca\u00f1on in which the horses were awaiting them. With unerring instinct Jefferson Hope picked his way among the great boulders and along the bed of a dried-up watercourse, until he came to the retired corner, screened with rocks, where the faithful animals had been picketed. The girl was placed upon the mule, and old Ferrier upon one of the horses, with his money-bag, while Jefferson Hope led the other along the precipitous and dangerous path. It was a bewildering route for anyone who was not accustomed to face Nature in her wildest moods. On the one side a great crag towered up a thousand feet or more, black, stern, and menacing, with long basaltic columns upon its rugged surface like the ribs of some petrified monster. On the other hand a wild chaos of boulders and debris made all advance impossible. Between the two ran the irregular track, so narrow in places that they had to travel in Indian file, and so rough that only practised riders could have traversed it at all.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"10#13\" wordCount=\"264\" sentimentScore=\"-0.24847058823529414\" fkGrade=\"6.9946340368208375\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.01392193308550186\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.00896654275092937\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.006271375464684015\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.01845353159851301\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.016368029739776954\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.0057211895910780665\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.023553903345724908\"/>\n            <Body>Yet in spite of all dangers and difficulties, the hearts of the fugitives were light within them, for every step increased the distance between them and the terrible despotism from which they were flying. They soon had a proof, however, that they were still within the jurisdiction of the Saints. They had reached the very wildest and most desolate portion of the pass when the girl gave a startled cry, and pointed upwards. On a rock which overlooked the track, showing out dark and plain against the sky, there stood a solitary sentinel. He saw them as soon as they perceived him, and his military challenge of \u201cWho goes there? \u201d rang through the silent ravine. \u201cTravellers for Nevada,\u201d said Jefferson Hope, with his hand upon the rifle which hung by his saddle. They could see the lonely watcher fingering his gun, and peering down at them as if dissatisfied at their reply. \u201cBy whose permission? \u201d he asked. \u201cThe Holy Four,\u201d answered Ferrier. His Mormon experiences had taught him that that was the highest authority to which he could refer. \u201cNine from seven,\u201d cried the sentinel. \u201cSeven from five,\u201d returned Jefferson Hope promptly, remembering the countersign which he had heard in the garden. \u201cPass, and the Lord go with you,\u201d said the voice from above. Beyond his post the path broadened out, and the horses were able to break into a trot. Looking back, they could see the solitary watcher leaning upon his gun, and knew that they had passed the outlying post of the chosen people, and that freedom lay before them.</Body>\n        </Block>\n    </Chapter>\n    <Chapter id=\"11\" title=\"CHAPTER V THE AVENGING ANGELS.\">\n        <Metadata wordCount=\"3538\" fkGrade=\"14.410062111801242\">\n            <Locations>\n                <Location name=\"St. Petersburg\" type=\"LOCATION\"/>\n                <Location name=\"Copenhagen\" type=\"LOCATION\"/>\n                <Location name=\"London\" type=\"LOCATION\"/>\n                <Location name=\"Nevada\" type=\"LOCATION\"/>\n    '), NULL);

More than once they lost their way, but Hope\u2019s intimate knowledge of the mountains enabled them to regain the track once more. When morning broke, a scene of marvellous though savage beauty lay before them. In every direction the great snow-capped peaks hemmed them in, peeping over each other\u2019s shoulders to the far horizon. So steep were the rocky banks on either side of them, that the larch and the pine seemed to be suspended over their heads, and to need only a gust of wind to come hurtling down upon them. Nor was the fear entirely an illusion, for the barren valley was thickly strewn with trees and boulders which had fallen in a similar manner. Even as they passed, a great rock came thundering down with a hoarse rattle which woke the echoes in the silent gorges, and startled the weary horses into a gallop. As the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon, the caps of the great mountains lit up one after the other, like lamps at a festival, until they were all ruddy and glowing. The magnificent spectacle cheered the hearts of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy. At a wild torrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and watered their horses, while they partook of a hasty breakfast.

At night-time they chose the base of a beetling crag, where the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind, and there huddled together for warmth, they enjoyed a few hours\u2019 sleep. Before daybreak, however, they were up and on their way once more. They had seen no signs of any pursuers, and Jefferson Hope began to think that they were fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whose enmity they had incurred. He little knew how far that iron grasp could reach, or how soon it was to close upon them and crush them. About the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store of provisions began to run out. This gave the hunter little uneasiness, however, for there was game to be had among the mountains, and he had frequently before had to depend upon his rifle for the needs of life. Choosing a sheltered nook, he piled together a few dried branches and made a blazing fire, at which his companions might warm themselves, for they were now nearly five thousand feet above the sea level, and the air was bitter and keen. Having tethered the horses, and bade Lucy adieu, he threw his gun over his shoulder, and set out in search of whatever chance might throw in his way.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"11#3\" wordCount=\"260\" sentimentScore=\"0.0\" fkGrade=\"11.199181818181817\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.010299242424242424\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.01446590909090909\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.008287878787878789\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.0234469696969697\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.009818181818181818\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.00443939393939394\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.010768939393939393\"/>\n            <Body>Looking back he saw the old man and the young girl crouching over the blazing fire, while the three animals stood motionless in the back-ground. Then the intervening rocks hid them from his view. He walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another without success, though from the marks upon the bark of the trees, and other indications, he judged that there were numerous bears in the vicinity. At last, after two or three hours\u2019 fruitless search, he was thinking of turning back in despair, when casting his eyes upwards he saw a sight which sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart. On the edge of a jutting pinnacle, three or four hundred feet above him, there stood a creature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance, but armed with a pair of gigantic horns. The big-horn--for so it is called--was acting, probably, as a guardian over a flock which were invisible to the hunter; but fortunately it was heading in the opposite direction, and had not perceived him. Lying on his face, he rested his rifle upon a rock, and took a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger. The animal sprang into the air, tottered for a moment upon the edge of the precipice, and then came crashing down into the valley beneath. The creature was too unwieldy to lift, so the hunter contented himself with cutting away one haunch and part of the flank. With this trophy over his shoulder, he hastened to retrace his steps, for the evening was already drawing in.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"11#4\" wordCount=\"262\" sentimentScore=\"-0.19054545454545455\" fkGrade=\"9.59756419153366\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.013307984790874524\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.005346007604562737\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.013372623574144486\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.022007604562737645\"/>\n            <Body>He had hardly started, however, before he realized the difficulty w'), NULL);

He followed one for a mile or more until he came to a mountain torrent which he was sure that he had never seen before. Convinced that he had taken the wrong turn, he tried another, but with the same result. Night was coming on rapidly, and it was almost dark before he at last found himself in a defile which was familiar to him. Even then it was no easy matter to keep to the right track, for the moon had not yet risen, and the high cliffs on either side made the obscurity more profound. Weighed down with his burden, and weary from his exertions, he stumbled along, keeping up his heart by the reflection that every step brought him nearer to Lucy, and that he carried with him enough to ensure them food for the remainder of their journey.

Again he shouted, even louder than before, and again no whisper came back from the friends whom he had left such a short time ago. A vague, nameless dread came over him, and he hurried onwards frantically, dropping the precious food in his agitation. When he turned the corner, he came full in sight of the spot where the fire had been lit. There was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there, but it had evidently not been tended since his departure. The same dead silence still reigned all round. With his fears all changed to convictions, he hurried on. There was no living creature near the remains of the fire: animals, man, maiden, all were gone. It was only too clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during his absence--a disaster which had embraced them all, and yet had left no traces behind it. Bewildered and stunned by this blow, Jefferson Hope felt his head spin round, and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling.

Had they carried back both of his companions with them? Jefferson Hope had almost persuaded himself that they must have done so, when his eye fell upon an object which made every nerve of his body tingle within him. A little way on one side of the camp was a low-lying heap of reddish soil, which had assuredly not been there before. There was no mistaking it for anything but a newly-dug grave. As the young hunter approached it, he perceived that a stick had been planted on it, with a sheet of paper stuck in the cleft fork of it. The inscription upon the paper was brief, but to the point: JOHN FERRIER, FORMERLY OF SALT LAKE CITY, [22] Died August 4th, 1860. The sturdy old man, whom he had left so short a time before, was gone, then, and this was all his epitaph. Jefferson Hope looked wildly round to see if there was a second grave, but there was no sign of one. Lucy had been carried back by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her original destiny, by becoming one of the harem of the Elder\u2019s son.

As he stood by the desolate fire, he felt that the only one thing which could assuage his grief would be thorough and complete retribution, brought by his own hand upon his enemies. His strong will and untiring energy should, he determined, be devoted to that one end. With a grim, white face, he retraced his steps to where he had dropped the food, and having stirred up the smouldering fire, he cooked enough to last him for a few days. This he made up into a bundle, and, tired as he was, he set himself to walk back through the mountains upon the track of the avenging angels.

No one won\u2019t have her very long though, for I saw death in her face yesterday. She is more like a ghost than a woman.

Once a bullet whistled through Stangerson\u2019s window and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot of him. On another occasion, as Drebber passed under a cliff a great boulder crashed down on him, and he only escaped a terrible death by throwing himself upon his face. The two young Mormons were not long in discovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives, and led repeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or killing their enemy, but always without success. Then they adopted the precaution of never going out alone or after nightfall, and of having their houses guarded. After a time they were able to relax these measures, for nothing was either heard or seen of their opponent, and they hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness. Far from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented it.

At the end of that time, however, his memory of his wrongs and his craving for revenge were quite as keen as on that memorable night when he had stood by John Ferrier\u2019s grave. Disguised, and under an assumed name, he returned to Salt Lake City, careless what became of his own life, as long as he obtained what he knew to be justice. There he found evil tidings awaiting him.

At last his perseverance was rewarded. It was but a glance of a face in a window, but that one glance told him that Cleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit of. He returned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance all arranged. It chanced, however, that Drebber, looking from his window, had recognized the vagrant in the street, and had read murder in his eyes.

After the lapse of time that has passed since their crime, it was impossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any court. I knew of their guilt though, and I determined that I should be judge, jury, and executioner all rolled into one.

Sometimes I followed them on my cab, and sometimes on foot, but the former was the best, for then they could not get away from me.

I did not mind that, however, as long as I could lay my hand upon the men I wanted. \u201cThey were very cunning, though. They must have thought that there was some chance of their being followed, for they would never go out alone, and never after nightfall.

Presently some luggage was brought out, and after a time Drebber and Stangerson followed it, and drove off. I whipped up my horse and kept within sight of them, feeling very ill at ease, for I feared that they were going to shift their quarters. At Euston Station they got out, and I left a boy to hold my horse, and followed them on to the platform. I heard them ask for the Liverpool train, and the guard answer that one had just gone and there would not be another for some hours. Stangerson seemed to be put out at that, but Drebber was rather pleased than otherwise. I got so close to them in the bustle that I could hear every word that passed between them. Drebber said that he had a little business of his own to do, and that if the other would wait for him he would soon rejoin him. His companion remonstrated with him, and reminded him that they had resolved to stick together. Drebber answered that the matter was a delicate one, and that he must go alone.

I had my enemies within my power. Together they could protect each other, but singly they were at my mercy. I did not act, however, with undue precipitation. My plans were already formed. There is no satisfaction in vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that strikes him, and why retribution has come upon him. I had my plans arranged by which I should have the opportunity of making the man who had wronged me understand that his old sin had found him out. It chanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in looking over some houses in the Brixton Road had dropped the key of one of them in my carriage. It was claimed that same evening, and returned; but in the interval I had taken a moulding of it, and had a duplicate constructed.

I had almost decided upon this, when he solved the problem for me. The craze for drink had seized him again, and he ordered me to pull up outside a gin palace.

I spotted the bottle in which this preparation was kept, and when they were all gone, I helped myself to a little of it. I was a fairly good dispenser, so I worked this alkaloid into small, soluble pills, and each pill I put in a box with a similar pill made without the poison. I determined at the time that when I had my chance, my gentlemen should each have a draw out of one of these boxes, while I ate the pill that remained.

No doubt it appeared to you to be a mere trampled line of slush, but to my trained eyes every mark upon its surface had a meaning. There is no branch of detective science which is so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps. Happily, I have always laid great stress upon it, and much practice has made it second nature to me. I saw the heavy footmarks of the constables, but I saw also the track of the two men who had first passed through the garden. It was easy to tell that they had been before the others, because in places their marks had been entirely obliterated by the others coming upon the top of them.

When the inscription was discovered upon the wall I was more inclined than ever to my opinion. The thing was too evidently a blind. When the ring was found, however, it settled the question. Clearly the murderer had used it to remind his victim of some dead or absent woman. It was at this point that I asked Gregson whether he had enquired in his telegram to Cleveland as to any particular point in Mr. Drebber\u2019s former career.

I could perceive that the track of blood coincided with the track of his feet. It is seldom that any man, unless he is very full-blooded, breaks out in this way through emotion, so I hazarded the opinion that the criminal was probably a robust and ruddy-faced man. Events proved that I had judged correctly. \u201cHaving left the house, I proceeded to do what Gregson had neglected.

They were the last\npeople you''d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious,\nbecause they just didn''t hold with such nonsense.\n\nMr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made\ndrills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did\nhave a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had\nnearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she\nspent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the\nneighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their\nopinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\n\nThe Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and\ntheir greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn''t\nthink they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs.\nPotter was Mrs. Dursley''s sister, but they hadn''t met for several years;\nin fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn''t have a sister, because her\nsister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was\npossible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would\nsay if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the\nPotters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy\nwas another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn''t want\nDudley mixing with a child like that.\n\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story\nstarts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that\nstrange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the\ncountry. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for\nwork, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming\nDudley into his high chair.\n\nNone of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.\n\nAt half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs.\nDursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed,\nbecause Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the\nwalls. \"Little tyke,\" chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got\ninto his car and backed out of number four''s drive.\n\nIt was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of\nsomething peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley\ndidn''t realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to\nlook again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet\nDrive, but there wasn''t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking\nof? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and\nstared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the\ncorner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now\nreading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats\ncouldn''t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and\nput the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of\nnothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\n\nBut on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something\nelse. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn''t help\nnoticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people\nabout. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn''t bear people who dressed in\nfunny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this\nwas some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering\nwheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite\nclose by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was\nenraged to see that a couple of them weren''t young at all; why, that man\nhad to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The\nnerve of him!

If he hadn''t, he might have found it harder to concentrate\non drills that morning. He didn''t see the owls swoop ing past in broad\ndaylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed\nopen- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never\nseen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly\nnormal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made\nseveral important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a\nvery good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he''d stretch his legs\nand walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.\n\nHe''d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of\nthem next to the baker''s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn''t\nknow why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering\nexcitedly, too, and he couldn''t see a single collecting tin. It was on\nhis way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he\ncaught a few words of what they were saying.\n\n\"The Potters, that''s right, that''s what I heard yes, their son, Harry\"\n\nMr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the\nwhisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better\nof it.\n\nHe dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his\nsecretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost\nfinished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the\nreceiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was\nbeing stupid. Potter wasn''t such an unusual name. He was sure there were\nlots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think\nof it, he wasn''t even sure his nephew was called Harry. He''d never even\nseen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point\nin worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her\nsister. He didn''t blame her -- if he''d had a sister like that... but all\nthe same, those people in cloaks...\n\nHe found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and\nwhen he left the building at five o''clock, he was still so worried that\nhe walked straight into someone just outside the door.\n\n\"Sorry,\" he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It\nwas a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a\nviolet cloak. He didn''t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the\nground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in\na squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \"Don''t be sorry, my dear sir,\nfor nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at\nlast! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy,\nhappy day!\"\n\nAnd the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.\n\nMr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete\nstranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that\nwas. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping\nhe was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he\ndidn''t approve of imagination.\n\nAs he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw --\nand it didn''t improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he''d spotted that\nmorning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the\nsame one; it had the same markings around its eyes.\n\n\"Shoo!\" said Mr. Dursley loudly. The cat didn''t move. It just gave him a\nstern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying\nto pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still\ndetermined not to mention anything to his wife.\n\nMrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all\nabout Mrs. Next Door''s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had\nlearned a new word (\"Won''t!\"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally.

It was sitting as\nstill as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of\nPrivet Drive.

But he did seem to\nrealize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat,\nwhich was still staring at him from the other end of the street.

Dumbledore, however, was choosing\nanother lemon drop and did not answer.\n\n\"What they''re saying,\" she pressed on, \"is that last night Voldemort\nturned up in Godric''s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is\nthat Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that they''re -- dead. \"\n\nDumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.\n\n\"Lily and James... I can''t believe it... I didn''t want to believe it...\nOh, Albus...\"\n\nDumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. \"I know... I\nknow...\" he said heavily.\n\nProfessor McGonagall''s voice trembled as she went on. \"That''s not all.\nThey''re saying he tried to kill the Potter''s son, Harry. But -- he\ncouldn''t. He couldn''t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how,\nbut they''re saying that when he couldn''t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort''s\npower somehow broke -- and that''s why he''s gone.\n\nDumbledore nodded glumly.\n\n\"It''s -- it''s true?\" faltered Professor McGonagall. \"After all he''s\ndone... all the people he''s killed... he couldn''t kill a little boy?\nIt''s just astounding... of all the things to stop him... but how in the\nname of heaven did Harry survive?\"\n\n\"We can only guess,\" said Dumbledore. \"We may never know.\"\n\nProfessor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her\neyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a\ngolden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch.\nIt had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving\naround the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because\nhe put it back in his pocket and said, \"Hagrid''s late. I suppose it was\nhe who told you I''d be here, by the way?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"And I don''t suppose you''re going to\ntell me why you''re here, of all places?\"\n\n\"I''ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They''re the only family\nhe has left now.\"\n\n\"You don''t mean -- you can''t mean the people who live here?\" cried\nProfessor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four.\n\"Dumbledore -- you can''t.

And they''ve got this son -- I saw\nhim kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets.\nHarry Potter come and live here!\"\n\n\"It''s the best place for him,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"His aunt and\nuncle will be able to explain everything to him when he''s older. I''ve\nwritten them a letter.\"\n\n\"A letter?\" repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on\nthe wall. \"Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a\nletter?

Only the\nphotographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed.\nTen years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a\nlarge pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -- but Dudley\nDursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large\nblond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a\ncomputer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother.\nThe room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.\n\nYet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for\nlong. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made\nthe first noise of the day.\n\n\"Up! Get up! Now!\"\n\nHarry woke with a start.

By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard\nagain, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his\nnew video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time\nout on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet\nDrive on her crutches.\n\nHarry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley''s gang,\nwho visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and\nGordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and\nstupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite\nhappy to join in Dudley''s favorite sport: Harry Hunting.\n\nThis was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house,\nwandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he\ncould see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off\nto secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn''t be\nwith Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon''s old private\nschool, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the\nother hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley\nthought this was very funny.\n\n\"They stuff people''s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,\"\nhe told Harry. \"Want to come upstairs and practice?\"\n\n\"No, thanks,\" said Harry. \"The poor toilet''s never had anything as\nhorrible as your head down it -- it might be sick.\" Then he ran, before\nDudley could work out what he''d said.\n\nOne day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings\nuniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg''s. Mrs. Figg wasn ''t as bad as\nusual. It turned out she''d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats,\nand she didn''t seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch\ntelevision and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though\nshe''d had it for several years.\n\nThat evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in\nhis brand-new uniform. Smeltings'' boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange\nknickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried\nknobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren''t\nlooking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.\n\nAs he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said\ngruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst\ninto tears and said she couldn''t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he\nlooked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn''t trust himself to speak. He\nthought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to\nlaugh.\n\nThere was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry\nwent in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in\nthe sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like\ndirty rags swimming in gray water.\n\n\"What''s this?\" he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always\ndid if he dared to ask a question.\n\n\"Your new school uniform,\" she said.\n\nHarry looked in the bowl again.\n\n\"Oh,\" he said, \"I didn''t realize it had to be so wet.\"\n\n\"DotA be stupid,\" snapped Aunt Petunia. \"I''m dyeing some of Dudley''s old\nthings gray for you. It''ll look just like everyone else''s when I''ve\nfinished.\"\n\nHarry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat\ndown at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look\non his first day at Stonewall High -- like he was wearing bits of old\nelephant skin, probably.\n\nDudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the\nsmell from Harry''s new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as\nusual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere,\non the table.\n\nThey heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the\ndoormat.\n\n\"Get the mail, Dudley,\" said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.\n\n\"Make Harry get it.\"\n\n\"Get the mail, Harry.\"\n\n\"Make'), NULL);

Three things\nlay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon''s sister Marge, who was\nvacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a\nbill, and -- a letter for Harry.\n\nHarry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant\nelastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who\nwould? He had no friends, no other relatives -- he didn''t belong to the\nlibrary, so he''d never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet\nhere it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:\n\nMr. H. Potter\n\nThe Cupboard under the Stairs\n\n4 Privet Drive\n\nLittle Whinging\n\nSurrey\n\nThe envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the\naddress was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp.\n\nTurning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax\nseal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake\nsurrounding a large letter H.\n\n\"Hurry up, boy!\" shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. \"What are you\ndoing, checking for letter bombs?\" He chuckled at his own joke.\n\nHarry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed\nUncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to\nopen the yellow envelope.\n\nUncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over\nthe postcard.\n\n\"Marge''s ill,\" he informed Aunt Petunia. \"Ate a funny whelk. --.\"\n\n\"Dad!\" said Dudley suddenly. \"Dad, Harry''s got something!\"\n\nHarry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the\nsame heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of\nhis hand by Uncle Vernon.\n\n\"That''s mine!\" said Harry, trying to snatch it back.\n\n\"Who''d be writing to you?\" sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open\nwith one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster\nthan a set of traffic lights. And it didn''t stop there. Within seconds\nit was the grayish white of old porridge.\n\n\"P-P-Petunia!\" he gasped.\n\nDudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it\nhigh out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first\nline. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her\nthroat and made a choking noise.\n\n\"Vernon! Oh my goodness -- Vernon!\"\n\nThey stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and\nDudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn''t used to being ignored. He\ngave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.\n\n\"I want to read that letter,\" he said loudly. want to read it,\" said\nHarry furiously, \"as it''s mine.\"\n\n\"Get out, both of you,\" croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back\ninside its envelope.\n\nHarry didn''t move.\n\nI WANT MY LETTER!\" he shouted.\n\n\"Let me see it!\" demanded Dudley.\n\n\"OUT!\" roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the\nscruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the\nkitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but\nsilent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry,\nhis glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at\nthe crack between door and floor.\n\n\"Vernon,\" Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, \"look at the\naddress -- how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don''t think\nthey''re watching the house?\"\n\n\"Watching -- spying -- might be following us,\" muttered Uncle Vernon\nwildly.\n\n\"But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don''t\nwant --\"\n\nHarry could see Uncle Vernon''s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the\nkitchen.\n\n\"No,\" he said finally. \"No, we''ll ignore it.

He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a\nsmile, which looked quite painful.\n\n\"Er -- yes, Harry -- about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been\nthinking... you''re really getting a bit big for it... we think it might\nbe nice if you moved into Dudley''s second bedroom.\n\n\"Why?\" said Harry.\n\n\"Don''t ask questions!\" snapped his uncle. \"Take this stuff upstairs,\nnow.\"\n\nThe Dursleys'' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt\nPetunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon''s sister, Marge), one\nwhere Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things\nthat wouldn''t fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip\nupstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He\nsat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was\nbroken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working\ntank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor''s dog; in the\ncorner was Dudley''s first-ever television set, which he''d put his foot\nthrough when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large\nbirdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school\nfor a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent\nbecause Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They\nwere the only things in the room that looked as though they''d never been\ntouched.\n\nFrom downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I don''t\nwant him in there... I need that room... make him get out....\"\n\nHarry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he''d have given\nanything to be up here. Today he''d rather be back in his cupboard with\nthat letter than up here without it.\n\nNext morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in\nshock. He''d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been\nsick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the\ngreenhouse roof, and he still didn''t have his room back. Harry was\nthinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he''d opened the\nletter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each\nother darkly.\n\nWhen the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice\nto Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with\nhis Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, \"There''s\nanother one! ''Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive --''\"\n\nWith a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the\nhall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the\nground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact\nthat Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a\nminute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the\nSmelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with\nHarry''s letter clutched in his hand.\n\n\"Go to your cupboard -- I mean, your bedroom,\" he wheezed at Harry.\n\"Dudley -- go -- just go.\"\n\nHarry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out\nof his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn''t received his first\nletter. Surely that meant they''d try again? And this time he''d make sure\nthey didn''t fail. He had a plan.\n\nThe repaired alarm clock rang at six o''clock the next morning. Harry\nturned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn''t wake the\nDursleys.

After a few minutes he stammered, \"What does\nit mean, they await my owl?\"\n\n\"Gallopin'' Gorgons, that reminds me,\" said Hagrid, clapping a hand to\nhis forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet\nanother pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl -- a real, live,\nrather ruffled-looking owl -- a long quill, and a roll of parchment.\nWith his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could\nread upside down:\n\nDear Professor Dumbledore,\n\nGiven Harry his letter.\n\nTaking him to buy his things tomorrow.\n\nWeather''s horrible.

Then he\ncame back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the\ntelephone.\n\nHarry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.\n\n\"Where was I?\" said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still\nashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.\n\n\"He''s not going,\" he said.\n\nHagrid grunted.\n\n\"I''d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,\" he said.\n\n\"A what?\" said Harry, interested.\n\n\"A Muggle,\" said Hagrid, \"it''s what we call nonmagic folk like thern.\nAn'' it''s your bad luck you grew up in a family o'' the biggest Muggles I\never laid eyes on.\"\n\n\"We swore when we took him in we''d put a stop to that rubbish,\" said\nUncle Vernon, \"swore we''d stamp it out of him!

Hagrid\nfolded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the\nstreet.\n\nPassersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town\nto the station. Harry couldn''t blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as\ntall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like\nparking meters and saying loudly, \"See that, Harry? Things these Muggles\ndream up, eh?\"\n\n\"Hagrid,\" said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, \"did you say\nthere are dragons at Gringotts?\"\n\n\"Well, so they say,\" said Hagrid. \"Crikey, I''d like a dragon.\"\n\n\"You''d like one?\"\n\n\"Wanted one ever since I was a kid -- here we go.\"\n\nThey had reached the station.

They passed book shops and music stores,\nhamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it\ncould sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of\nordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles\nbeneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and\nbroomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had\ncooked up?

Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the\nrecord shop on the other as if they couldn''t see the Leaky Cauldron at\nall. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and\nHagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered\nhim inside.\n\nFor a famous place, it was very dark and shabby.

Everyone seemed to know\nHagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a\nglass, saying, \"The usual, Hagrid?\"\n\n\"Can''t, Tom, I''m on Hogwarts business,\" said Hagrid, clapping his great\nhand on Harry''s shoulder and making Harry''s knees buckle.\n\n\n\"Good Lord,\" said the bartender, peering at Harry, \"is this -- can this\nbe --?\"\n\n\nThe Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.\n\n\"Bless my soul,\" whispered the old bartender, \"Harry Potter... what an\nhonor.\"\n\nHe hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his\nhand, tears in his eyes.\n\n\"Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.\"\n\nHarry didn''t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him.

True, Dudley was now so\nscared of Harry he wouldn''t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia\nand Uncle Vernon didn''t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do\nanything, or shout at him -- in fact, they didn''t speak to him at all.\nHalf terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry\nin it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did\nbecome a bit depressing after a while.\n\nHarry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to\ncall her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school\nbooks were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the\nnight, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It\nwas lucky that Aunt Petunia didn''t come in to vacuum anymore, because\nHedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to\nsleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned\nto the wall, counting down to September the first.\n\nOn the last day of August he thought he''d better speak to his aunt and\nuncle about getting to King''s Cross station the next day, so he went\ndown to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on\ntelevision. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and\nDudley screamed and ran from the room.\n\n\"Er -- Uncle Vernon?\"\n\nUncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.\n\n\"Er -- I need to be at King''s Cross tomorrow to -- to go to Hogwarts.\"\n\nUncle Vernon grunted again.\n\n\"Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?\"\n\nGrunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nHe was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.\n\n\"Funny way to get to a wizards'' school, the train. Magic carpets all got\npunctures, have they?\"\n\nHarry didn''t say anything.\n\n\"Where is this school, anyway?\"\n\n\"I don''t know,\" said Harry, realizing this for the first time.

You''ll see.\nYou just wait. All right, we''ll take you to King''s Cross. We''re going up\nto London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn''t bother.\"\n\n\"Why are you going to London?\" Harry asked, trying to keep things\nfriendly.\n\n\"Taking Dudley to the hospital,\" growled Uncle Vernon. \"Got to have that\nruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.\"\n\nHarry woke at five o''clock the next morning and was too excited and\nnervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because\nhe didn''t want to walk into the station in his wizard''s robes -- he''d\nchange on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure\nhe had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her\ncage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two\nhours later, Harry''s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the\nDursleys'' car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to\nHarry, and they had set off.\n\nThey reached King''s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry''s\ntrunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought\nthis was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the\nplatforms with a nasty grin on his face.\n\n\"Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine -- platform ten. Your platform\nshould be somewhere in the middle, but they don''t seem to have built it\nyet, do they?\"\n\nHe was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over\none platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and\nin the middle, nothing at all.\n\n\"Have a good term,\" said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He\nleft without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away.\nAll three of them were laughing. Harry''s mouth went rather dry. What on\nearth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny\nlooks, because of Hedwig. He''d have to ask someone.\n\nHe stopped a passing guard, but didn''t dare mention platform nine and\nthree-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry\ncouldn''t even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to\nget annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting\ndesperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o''clock, but\nthe guard said there wasn''t one. In the end the guard strode away,\nmuttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic.\nAccording to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes\nleft to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he\nwas stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly\nlift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.\n\nHagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like\ntapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He\nwondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket\ninspector''s stand between platforms nine and ten.\n\nAt that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a\nfew words of what they were saying.\n\n\"-- packed with Muggles, of course --\"\n\nHarry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four\nboys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like\nHarry''s in front of him -- and they had an owl.\n\nHeart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so\ndid he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.\n\n\"Now, what''s the platform number?\" said the boys'' mother.\n\n\"Nine and three-quarters!\" piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was\nholding her hand, \"Mom, can''t I go... \"\n\n\"You''re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet.

He put Hedwig inside first and then started\nto shove and heave his trunk toward the train door.

They\ncrowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have\ndone, peering about nervously.\n\n\"Welcome to Hogwarts,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"The start-of-term\nbanquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great\nHall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very\nimportant ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be\nsomething like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with\nthe rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free\ntime in your house common room.\n\n\"The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and\nSlytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced\noutstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your\ntriumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose\nhouse points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is\nawarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a\ncredit to whichever house becomes yours.\n\n\"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the\nrest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as\nyou can while you are waiting.\"\n\nHer eyes lingered for a moment on Neville''s cloak, which was fastened\nunder his left ear, and on Ron''s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to\nflatten his hair.\n\n\"I shall return when we are ready for you,\" said Professor McGonagall.\n\"Please wait quietly.\"\n\nShe left the chamber. Harry swallowed.\n\n\"How exactly do they sort us into houses?\" he asked Ron.\n\n\"Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he\nwas joking.\"\n\nHarry''s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole\nschool? But he didn''t know any magic yet -- what on earth would he have\nto do? He hadn''t expected something like this the moment they arrived.\nHe looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified,\ntoo. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering\nvery fast about all the spells she''d learned and wondering which one\nshe''d need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He''d never been more\nnervous, never, not even when he''d had to take a school report home to\nthe Dursleys saying that he''d somehow turned his teacher''s wig blue. He\nkept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall\nwould come back and lead him to his doom.\n\nThen something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air --\nseveral people behind him screamed.\n\n\"What the --?\"\n\nHe gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just\nstreamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent,\nthey glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing\nat the first years. They seemed to be arguing.

One by one, the ghosts floated away\nthrough the opposite wall.\n\n\"Now, form a line,\" Professor McGonagall told the first years, \"and\nfollow me.\"\n\nFeeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line\nbehind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out\nof the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors\ninto the Great Hall.\n\nHarry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was\nlit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair\nover four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting.\nThese tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the\ntop of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting.\nProfessor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a\nhalt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them.\nThe hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the\nflickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the\nghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry\nlooked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He\nheard\n\nHermione whisper, \"Its bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read\nabout it in Hogwarts, A History.\"\n\nIt was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the\nGreat Hall didn''t simply open on to the heavens.\n\nHarry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed\na four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she\nput a pointed wizard''s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and\nextremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn''t have let it in the house.\n\nMaybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly,\nthat seemed the sort of thing -- noticing that everyone in the hall was\nnow staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there\nwas complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened\nwide like a mouth -- and the hat began to sing:\n\n\"Oh, you may not think I''m pretty,\n\nBut don''t judge on what you see,\n\nI''ll eat myself if you can find\n\nA smarter hat than me.\n\nYou can keep your bowlers black,\n\nYour top hats sleek and tall,\n\nFor I''m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat\n\nAnd I can cap them all.\n\nThere''s nothing hidden in your head\n\nThe Sorting Hat can''t see,\n\nSo try me on and I will tell you\n\nWhere you ought to be.\n\nYou might belong in Gryffindor,\n\nWhere dwell the brave at heart,\n\nTheir daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart;\n\nYou might belong in Hufflepuff,\n\nWhere they are just and loyal,\n\nThose patient Hufflepuffis are true And unafraid of toil;\n\nOr yet in wise old Ravenclaw,\n\nif you''ve a ready mind,\n\nWhere those of wit and learning,\n\nWill always find their kind;\n\nOr perhaps in Slytherin\n\nYou''ll make your real friends,\n\nThose cunning folk use any means\n\nTo achieve their ends.\n\nSo put me on! Don''t be afraid!\n\nAnd don''t get in a flap!\n\nYou''re in safe hands (though I have none)\n\nFor I''m a Thinking Cap!\"\n\nThe whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It\nbowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.\n\n\"So we''ve just got to try on the hat!\" Ron whispered to Harry. \"I''ll\nkill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.\"\n\nHarry. smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than\nhaving to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on\nwithout everyone watching.

They were half hoping for a reason\nto fight Malfay, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble\nquicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.\n\n\"What''s going on?\"\n\n\"Malfoy''s got my Remembrall, Professor.\"\n\nScowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.\n\n\"Just looking,\" he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind\nhim.\n\nAt three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors\nhurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying\nlesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their\nfeet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn\non the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees\nwere swaying darkly in the distance.\n\nThe Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying\nin neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley\ncomplain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to\nvibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.\n\nTheir teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and\nyellow eyes like a hawk.\n\n\"Well, what are you all waiting for?\" she barked. \"Everyone stand by a\nbroomstick. Come on, hurry up.\"\n\nHarry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck\nout at odd angles.\n\n\"Stick out your right hand over your broom,\" called Madam Hooch at the\nfront, \"and say ''Up!\"''\n\n\"UPF everyone shouted.\n\nHarry''s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few\nthat did. Hermione Granger''s had simply rolled over on the ground, and\nNeville''s hadn''t moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell\nwhen you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville''s\nvoice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the\nground.\n\nMadam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding\noff the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips.\nHarry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he''d been doing it\nwrong for years.\n\n\"Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,\" said\nMadam Hooch. \"Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come\nstraight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle -- three\n-- two --\"\n\nBut Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the\nground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch''s\nlips.\n\n\"Come back, boy!\" she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a\ncork shot out of a bottle -- twelve feet -- twenty feet. Harry saw his\nscared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp,\nslip sideways off the broom and --\n\nWHAM -- a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass\nin a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and\nstarted to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.\n\nMadam Hooc'), NULL);

Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom\nand kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed\nthrough his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him -and in a rush of\nfierce joy he realized he''d found something he could do without being\ntaught -- this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up\na little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls\nback on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.\n\nHe turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked\nstunned.\n\n\"Give it here,\" Harry called, \"or I''ll knock you off that broom!\" \"Oh,\nyeah?\" said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.\n\nHarry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom\ntightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfay like a javelin. Malfoy\nonly just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and\nheld the broom steady. A few people below were clapping.\n\n\"No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,\" Harry called.\n\nThe same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.\n\n\"Catch it if you can, then!\" he shouted, and he threw the glass ball\nhigh into the air and streaked back toward the ground.\n\nHarry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and\nthen start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down\n-- next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball\n-- wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people\nwatching -- he stretched out his hand -- a foot from the ground he\ncaught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled\ngently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.\n\n\"HARRY POTTER!\"\n\nHis heart sank faster than he''d just dived.

It\nkept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying\nunder his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he''d be\nlearning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without\nnoticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap\nthe Nimbus Two Thousand at last.\n\n\"Wow,\" Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry''s bedspread.\n\nEven Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it\nlooked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long\ntail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold\nnear the top.\n\nAs seven o''clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the\ndusk toward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadium\nbefore. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that\nthe spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end\nof the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end.

What a feeling -- he swooped in and out\nof the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two\nThousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.\n\n\"Hey, Potter, come down!''\n\nOliver Wood had arrived. fie was carrying a large wooden crate under his\narm.

I''m just going to teach you the rules\nthis evening, then you''ll be joining team practice three times a week.\"\n\nHe opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.\n\n\"Right,\" said Wood. \"Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even\nif it''s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side.\nThree of them are called Chasers.\"\n\n\"Three Chasers,\" Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball\nabout the size of a soccer ball.\n\n\"This ball''s called the Quaffle,\" said Wood. \"The Chasers throw the\nQuaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to\nscore a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the\nhoops.

I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other\nteam from scoring.\"\n\n\"Three Chasers, one Keeper,\" said Harry, who was determined to remember\nit all. \"And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are\nthey for?\" He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.\n\n\"I''ll show you now,\" said Wood. \"Take this.\"\n\nHe handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.\n\n\"I''m going to show you what the Bludgers do,\" Wood said. \"These two are\nthe Bludgers.\"\n\nHe showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than\nthe red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to\nescape the straps holding them inside the box.\n\n\"Stand back,\" Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the\nBludgers.\n\nAt once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at\nHarry''s face.

We''ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse\nthan that. Now, the last member of the team is the\n\nSeeker. That''s you. And you don''t have to worry about the Quaffle or the\nBludgers unless they crack my head open.\"\n\n\"Don''t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers -- I\nmean, they''re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.\"\n\nWood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball.\nCompared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size\nof a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver\nwings.\n\n\"This,\" said Wood, \"is the Golden Snitch, and it''s the most important\nball of the lot. It''s very hard to catch because it''s so fast and\ndifficult to see. It''s the Seeker''s job to catch it. You''ve got to weave\nin and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it\nbefore the other team''s Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the\nSnitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they\n\nnearly always win. That''s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of\nQuidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages\n-- I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on\nsubstitutes so the players could get some sleep. \"Well, that''s it -- any\nquestions?\"\n\nHarry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was\ndoing it that was going to be the problem.\n\n\"We won''t practice with the Snitch yet,\" said Wood, carefully shutting\nit back inside the crate, \"it''s too dark, we might lose it. Let''s try\nyou out with a few of these.\"\n\nHe pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few\nminutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf\nballs as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.\n\nHarry didn''t miss a single one, and Wood was delighted.

Neville\nwas snoring loudly, but Harry couldn''t sleep. He tried to empty his mind\n-- he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a\nfew hours -- but the expression on Snape''s face when Harry had seen his\nleg wasn''t easy to forget.\n\nThe next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall was full of\nthe delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer ful chatter of\neveryone looking forward to a good Quidditch match.\n\n\"You''ve got to eat some breakfast.\"\n\n\"I don''t want anything.\"\n\n\"Just a bit of toast,\" wheedled Hermione.\n\n\"I''m not hungry.\"\n\nHarry felt terrible. In an hour''s time he''d be walking onto the field.\n\n\"Harry, you need your strength,\" said Seamus Finnigan. \"Seekers are\nalways the ones who get clobbered by the other team.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Seamus,\" said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his\nsausages.\n\nBy eleven o''clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around\nthe Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be\nraised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going\non sometimes.\n\nRon and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in\nthe top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on\none of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President, and\nDean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion\nunderneath. Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that\nthe paint flashed different colors.\n\nMeanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were\nchanging into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing\nin green).\n\nWood cleared his throat for silence.\n\n\"Okay, men,\" he said.\n\n\"And women,\" said Chaser Angelina Johnson.\n\n\"And women,\" Wood agreed. \"This is it.\"\n\n\"The big one,\" said Fred Weasley.\n\n\"The one we''ve all been waiting for,\" said George.\n\n\"We know Oliver''s sp'), NULL);

The\nfew owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to\ndeliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could\nfly off again.\n\nNo one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor common\nroom and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had\nbecome icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms.\nWorst of all were Professor Snape''s classes down in the dungeons, where\ntheir breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as\npossible to their hot cauldrons.\n\n\"I do feel so sorry,\" said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, \"for all\nthose people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they''re\nnot wanted at home.\"\n\nHe was looking over at Harry as he spoke.

Then he''d realized that nobody found this funny,\nbecause they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay\non his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back\nto taunting Harry about having no proper family.\n\nIt was true that Harry wasn''t going back to Privet Drive for Christmas.\nProfessor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of\nstudents who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up\nat once.

Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the\nteachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he''d never\nget one.

They were sure she''d be\nable to tell them, but they couldn''t risk Snape hearing what they were\nup to.\n\nHarry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found\nanything, but he wasn''t very hopeful. They had been looking for two\nweeks, after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it\nwasn''t surprising they''d found nothing.

These fantastic party favors were nothing like the\nfeeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little\nplastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard\ncracker with Fred and it didn''t just bang, it went off with a blast like\na cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the\ninside exploded a rear admiral''s hat and several live, white mice. Up at\nthe High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard''s hat for a\nflowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick\nhad just read him.\n\nFlaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey.

Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they\nreturned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in\nhis new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron.

Something held him back\n-- his father''s cloak -- he felt that this time -- the first time -- he\nwanted to use it alone.\n\nHe crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room,\nand climbed through the portrait hole.\n\n\"Who''s there?\" squawked the Fat Lady.

Step ping\ncarefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the\nlibrary, he held up his lamp to read the titles.\n\nThey didn''t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled\nwords in languages Harry couldn''t understand. Some had no title at all.\nOne book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The\nhairs on the back of Harry''s neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it,\nmaybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books,\nas though they knew someone was there who shouldn''t be.\n\nHe had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor,\nhe looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book. A large\nblack and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with\ndifficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee,\nlet it fall open.\n\nA piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence -- the book was\nscreaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one\nhigh, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over\nhis lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming\ndown the corridor outside -- stuffing the shrieking book back on the\nshelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch''s pale, wild\neyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch''s\noutstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book''s shrieks\nstill ringing in his ears.\n\nHe came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been\nso busy getting away from the library, he hadn''t paid attention to where\nhe was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn''t recognize where he\nwas at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he\nmust be five floors above there.\n\n\"You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was\nwandering around at night, and somebody''s been in the library Restricted\nSection.\"\n\nHarry felt the blood drain out of his face.

Over and over again he dreamed\nabout his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high\nvoice cackled with laughter.\n\n\"You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,\" said\nRon, when Harry told him about these drearns.\n\nHermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different\nview of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being\nout of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (\"If Filch had\ncaught you!\"), and disappointment that he hadn''t at least found out who\nNicolas Flamel was.\n\nThey had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a li- brary\nbook, even though Harry was still sure he''d read the name somewhere.\nOnce term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten\nminutes during their breaks.

Even the endless rain that\nhad replaced the snow couldn''t dampen his spirits. The Weasleys\ncomplained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood''s\nside. If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would\novertake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven\nyears. Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer\nnightmares when he was tired out after training.\n\nThen, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave\nthe team a bit of bad news.

UP another\nstaircase, then another -- even one of Harry''s shortcuts didn''t make the\nwork much easier.\n\n\"Nearly there!\" Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the\ntallest tower.\n\nThen a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate.\nForgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the\nshadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each\nother ten feet away. A lamp flared.\n\nProfessor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by\nthe ear.\n\n\"Detention!\" she shouted. \"And twenty points from Slytherin!

How dare you tell such lies! Come on -- I shall see\nProfessor Snape about you, Malfoy!\"\n\nThe steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest\nthing in the world after that. Not until they''d stepped out into the\ncold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe\nproperly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.\n\n\"Malfoy''s got detention! I could sing!\"\n\n\"Don''t,\" Harry advised her.\n\nChuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his\ncrate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out\nof the darkness.\n\nCharlie''s friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and Hermione the\nharness they''d rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them.\nThey all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and\nHermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much.\n\nAt last, Norbert was going... going... gone.\n\nThey slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as\ntheir hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon -- Malfoy in\ndetention -- what could spoil their happiness?\n\nThe answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they\nstepped into the corridor, Filch''s face loomed suddenly out of the\ndarkness.\n\n\"Well, well, well,\" he whispered, \"we are in trouble.\"\n\nThey''d left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower.\n\n\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\n\nTHE FORIBIDDEN FOREST.\n\nThings couldn''t have been worse.\n\nFilch took them down to Professor McGonagall''s study on the first floor,\nwhere they sat and waited without saying a word to each other.

He couldn''t\nsee how they were going to get out of trouble this time. They were\ncornered. How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak?\nThere was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for\ntheir being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of\nnight, let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower, which was\nout-of-bounds except for classes.

They didn''t have as bad a time\nas Harry, because they weren''t as well-known, but nobody would speak to\nthem, either. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in\nclass, keeping her head down and working in silence.\n\nHarry was almost glad that the exams weren''t far away.

Harry told them what he''d heard.\n\n\"Snape''s done it, then!\" said Ron. \"If Quirrell''s told him how to break\nhis Anti-Dark Force spell --\"\n\n\"There''s still Fluffy, though,\" said Hermione.\n\n\"Maybe Snape''s found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,\"\nsaid Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. \"I bet\nthere''s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant\nthree-headed dog.

Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Harry''s\nseemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig.\nWhat was going on? Where were the others?\n\nAt last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid''s return. Malfoy,\nNeville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed,\nhad sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had\npanicked and sent up the sparks.\n\n\"We''ll be lucky ter catch anythin'' now, with the racket you two were\nmakin''.

They\nwalked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until\nthe path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so\nthick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were\nsplashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been\nthrashing around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing ahead,\nthrough the tangled branches of an ancient oak.\n\n\"Look --\" he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.\n\nSomething bright white was gleaming on the ground.

I suppose it''s here to break the fall.\nCome on, Hermione!\"\n\nThe distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but\nHermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry''s other side.\n\n\"We must be miles under the school , she said.\n\n\"Lucky this plant thing''s here, really,\" said Ron.\n\n\"Lucky!\" shrieked Hermione. \"Look at you both!\"\n\nShe leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle\nbecause the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist\nsnakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs\nhad already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.\n\nHermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on\nher. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant\noff them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster\nthe plant wound around them.\n\n\"Stop moving!\" Hermione ordered them. \"I know what this is -- it''s\nDevil''s Snare!\"\n\n\"Oh, I''m so glad we know what it''s called, that''s a great help,\" snarled\nRon, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his\nneck. \"Shut up, I''m trying to remember how to kill it!\" said Hermione.\n\n\"Well, hurry up, I can''t breathe!\" Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it\ncurled around his chest.\n\n\"Devil''s Snare, Devil''s Snare... what did Professor Sprout say? -- it\nlikes the dark and the damp\n\n\"So light a fire!\" Harry choked.\n\n\"Yes -- of course -- but there''s no wood!\" Hermione cried, wringing her\nhands.\n\n\"HAVE YOU GONE MAD?\" Ron bellowed. \"ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?\"\n\n\"Oh, right!\" said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it,\nmuttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had\nused on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it\nloosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth.\nWriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they\nwere able to pull free.\n\n\"Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,\" said Harry as he\njoined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Ron, \"and lucky Harry doesn''t lose his head in a crisis --\n''there''s no wood,'' honestly.\"\n\n\"This way,\" said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the\nonly way forward.\n\nAll they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of\nwater trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and\nHarry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart,\nhe remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards''\nbank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon -- Norbert had been bad\nenough...\n\n\"Can you hear something?\" Ron whispered.\n\nHarry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up\nahead.\n\n\"Do you think it''s a ghost?\"\n\n\"I don''t know... sounds like wings to me.\"\n\n\"There''s light ahead -- I can see something moving.\"\n\nThey reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly\nlit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small,\njewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the\nopposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.\n\n\"Do you think they''ll attack us if we cross the room?\" said Ron.\n\n\"Probably,\" said Harry. \"They don''t look very vicious, but I suppose if\nthey all swooped down at once... well, there''s no other choice... I''ll\nrun.\"\n\nHe took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted\nacross the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at\nhim any second, but nothing happened.

Winged keys --\nlook carefully. So that must mean...\" he looked around the chamber while\nthe other two squinted up at the flock of keys. \"... yes -- look!\nBroomsticks! We''ve got to catch the key to the door!\"\n\n\"But there are hundreds of them!\"\n\nRon examined the lock on the door.\n\n\"We''re looking for a big, old-fashioned one -- probably silver, like the\nhandle.\"\n\nThey each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into\nthe midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the\nbewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to\ncatch one.\n\nNot for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He\nhad a knack for spotting things other people didn''t. After a minute''s\nweaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large\nsilver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and\nstuffed roughly into the keyhole.\n\n\"That one!\" he called to the others. \"That big one -- there -- no, there\n-- with bright blue wings -- the feathers are all crumpled on one side.\"\n\nRon went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into\nthe ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.\n\n\"We''ve got to close in on it!\" Harry called, not taking his eyes off the\nkey with the damaged wing. \"Ron, you come at it from above -- Hermione,\nstay below and stop it from going down and I''ll try and catch it. Right,\nNOW!\"\n\nRon dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry\nstreaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and\nwith a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one\nhand. Ron and Hermione''s cheers echoed around the high chamber.\n\nThey landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in\nhis hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned -- it worked. The moment\nthe lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very\nbattered now that it had been caught twice.\n\n\"Ready?\" Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They\nnodded. He pulled the door open.\n\nThe next chamber was so dark they couldn''t see anything at all. But as\nthey stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an\nastonishing sight.\n\nThey were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black\nchessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what\nlooked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the\nwhite pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly -- the towering\nwhite chessmen had no faces.\n\n\"Now what do we do?\" Harry whispered.\n\n\"It''s obvious, isn''t it?\" said Ron. \"We''ve got to play our way across\nthe room.\"\n\nBehind the white pieces they could see another door.\n\n\"How?\" said Hermione nervously.\n\n\"I think,\" said Ron, \"we''re going to have to be chessmen.\"\n\nHe walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the\nknight''s horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the\nground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.\n\n\"Do we -- er -- have to join you to get across?\" The black knight\nnodded. Ron turned to the other two.\n\n\"This needs thinking about \the said. I suppose we''ve got to take the\nplace of three of the black pieces....\"\n\nHarry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said,\n\"Now, don''t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at\nchess --\"\n\n\"We''re not offended,\" said Harry quickly. \"Just tell us what to do.\"\n\n\"Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, YOU 90\nnext to him instead of that castle.\"\n\n\"What about you?\"\n\n\"I''m going to be a knight,\" said Ron.\n\nThe chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a\nknight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces\nand walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron,\nand Hermione took.\n\n\"White alway'), NULL);

What if they lost?\n\n\"Harry -- move diagonally four squares to the right.\"\n\nTheir first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white\nqueen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he\nlay quite still, facedown.\n\n\"Had to let that happen,\" said Ron, looking shaken. \"Leaves you free to\ntake that bishop, Hermione, go on.\"\n\nEvery time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy.\nSoon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall.\nTwice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in\ndanger.

She struck Ron hard\nacross the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor -\nHermione screamed but stayed on her square - the white queen dragged Ron\nto one side. He looked as if he''d been knocked out.\n\nShaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.\n\nThe white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry''s feet. They had\nwon. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear.

Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in\nfront of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out\ncold with a bloody lump on its head.\n\n\"I''m glad we didn''t have to fight that one,\" Harry whispered as they\nstepped carefully over one of its massive legs. \"Come on, I can''t\nbreathe.\"\n\nHe pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what\ncame next - but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table\nwith seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.\n\n\"Snape''s,\" said Harry. \"What do we have to do?\"\n\nThey stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind\nthem in the doorway.

After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great\nadventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As\nmuch money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings\nwould choose above all -- the trouble is, humans do have a knack of\nchoosing precisely those things that are worst for them.\" Harry lay\nthere, lost for words.

He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking\nfor another body to share... not being truly alive, he cannot be killed.\nHe left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers\nas his enemies.

Then\nhe said, \"Sir, there are some other things I''d like to know, if you can\ntell me... things I want to know the truth about....\"\n\n\"The truth.\" Dumbledore sighed. \"It is a beautiful and terrible thing,\nand should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall\nanswer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which\ncase I beg you''ll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.\"\n\n\"Well... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried\nto stop him from killing me.

You will know, one day... put it from your mind for now, Harry.\nWhen you are older... I know you hate to hear this... when you are\nready, you will know.\"\n\nAnd Harry knew it would be no good to argue.\n\n\"But why couldn''t Quirrell touch me?\"\n\n\"Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot\nunderstand, it is love. He didn''t realize that love as powerful as your\nmother''s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign... to\nhave been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone,\nwill give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell,\nfull of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort,\ncould not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person\nmarked by something so good.\"\n\nDumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill,\nwhich gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet.

Ron and Hermione were a\nvery good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry\ntold them what was under Quirrell''s turban, Hermione screamed out loud.\n\n\"So the Stone''s gone?\" said Ron finally. \"Flamel''s just going to die?\"\n\n\"That''s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that -- what was it? -- ''to\nthe well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.\n\n\"I always said he was off his rocker,\" said Ron, looking quite impressed\nat how crazy his hero was.\n\n\"So what happened to you two?\" said Harry.\n\n\"Well, I got back all right,\" said Hermione. \"I brought Ron round --\nthat took a while -- and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact\nDumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall -- he already knew -- he\njust said, ''Harry''s gone after him, hasn''t he?'' and hurtled off to the\nthird floor.\"\n\n\"D''you think he meant you to do it?\" said Ron. \"Sending you your\nfather''s cloak and everything?\"\n\n\"Well, \" Hermione exploded, \"if he did -- I mean to say that''s terrible\n-- you could have been killed.\"\n\n\"No, it isn''t,\" said Harry thoughtfully. \"He''s a funny man, Dumbledore.\nI think he sort of wanted to give me a chance.

A huge banner\nshowing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table.\n\nWhen Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started\ntalking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione\nat the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were\nstanding up to look at him.\n\nFortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later.

They were the last people you''d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn''t hold with such nonsense. Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn''t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley''s sister, but they hadn''t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn''t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn''t want Dudley mixing with a child like that. When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair. None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window. At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. \" Little tyke,\" chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four''s drive. It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn''t realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn''t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats couldn''t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day. But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn''t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn''t bear people who dressed in funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren''t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt -- these people were obviously col'), NULL);

The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills. Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn''t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn''t see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he''d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery. He''d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker''s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn''t know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn''t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying. " The Potters, that''s right, that''s what I heard yes, their son, Harry" Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it. He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn''t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn''t even sure his nephew was called Harry. He''d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn''t blame her -- if he''d had a sister like that... but all the same, those people in cloaks... He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o''clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door. " Sorry," he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn''t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, "Don''t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!" And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off. Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn''t approve of imagination. As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw -- and it didn''t improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he''d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes. " Shoo!" said Mr. Dursley loudly. The cat didn''t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife. Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day.

Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?" " Well, Ted," said the weatherman, "I don''t know about that, but it''s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they''ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it''s not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight." Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters... Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He''d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. " Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven''t heard from your sister lately, have you?" As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn''t have a sister. " No," she said sharply. " Why?" " Funny stuff on the news," Mr. Dursley mumbled. " Owls... shooting stars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today..." "So?" snapped Mrs. Dursley. " Well, I just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you know... her crowd." Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he''d heard the name "Potter." He decided he didn''t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, "Their son -- he''d be about Dudley''s age now, wouldn''t he?" " I suppose so," said Mrs. Dursley stiffly. " What''s his name again? Howard, isn''t it?" " Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me." " Oh, yes," said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. " Yes, I quite agree." He didn''t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something. Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did... if it got out that they were related to a pair of -- well, he didn''t think he could bear it. The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind.... He couldn''t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on -- he yawned and turned over -- it couldn''t affect them.... How very wrong he was. Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn''t so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all. A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you''d have thought he''d just popped out of the ground. The cat''s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed. Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tu', NULL);

His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man''s name was Albus Dumbledore. Albus Dumbledore didn''t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, "I should have known." He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn''t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn''t look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it. " Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall." He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled. " How did you know it was me?" she asked. " My dear Professor, I ''ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly." " You''d be stiff if you''d been sitting on a brick wall all day," said Professor McGonagall. " All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here." Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily. " Oh yes, everyone''s celebrating, all right," she said impatiently. " You''d think they''d be a bit more careful, but no -- even the Muggles have noticed something''s going on. It was on their news." She jerked her head back at the Dursleys'' dark living-room window. " I heard it. Flocks of owls... shooting stars.... Well, they''re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent -- I''ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense." " You can''t blame them," said Dumbledore gently. " We''ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years." " I know that," said Professor McGonagall irritably. " But that''s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors." She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn''t, so she went on. " A fine thing it would be if, on the very day YouKnow-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?" " It certainly seems so," said Dumbledore. " We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?" " A what?" " A lemon drop. They''re a kind of Muggle sweet I''m rather fond of" "No, thank you," said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn''t think this was the moment for lemon drops. " As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone -" "My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this ''You- Know-Who'' nonsense -- for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort." Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. " ', NULL);

" I know you haven ''t, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. " But you''re different. Everyone knows you''re the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of." " You flatter me," said Dumbledore calmly. " Voldemort had powers I will never have." " Only because you''re too -- well -- noble to use them." " It''s lucky it''s dark. I haven''t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs." Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, "The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what everyone''s saying? About why he''s disappeared? About what finally stopped him?" It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever "everyone" was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer. " What they''re saying," she pressed on, "is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric''s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that they''re -- dead. " Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped. " Lily and James... I can''t believe it... I didn''t want to believe it... Oh, Albus..." Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. " I know... I know..." he said heavily. Professor McGonagall''s voice trembled as she went on. " That''s not all. They''re saying he tried to kill the Potter''s son, Harry. But -- he couldn''t. He couldn''t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they''re saying that when he couldn''t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort''s power somehow broke -- and that''s why he''s gone. Dumbledore nodded glumly. " It''s -- it''s true?" faltered Professor McGonagall. " After all he''s done... all the people he''s killed... he couldn''t kill a little boy? It''s just astounding... of all the things to stop him... but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?" " We can only guess," said Dumbledore. " We may never know." Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, "Hagrid''s late. I suppose it was he who told you I''d be here, by the way?" " Yes," said Professor McGonagall. " And I don''t suppose you''re going to tell me why you''re here, of all places?" " I''ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They''re the only family he has left now." " You don''t mean -- you can''t mean the people who live here?" cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. " Dumbledore -- you can''t. I''ve been watching them all day. You couldn''t find two people who are less like us. And they''ve got this son -- I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!" " It''s the best place for him," said Dumbledore firmly. " His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he''s older. I''ve written them a letter." " A letter?" repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. " Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He''ll be famous -- a legend -- I wouldn''t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future -- there will be books written about Harry -- every child in our world will know his name!"

CarA you see how much better off he''ll be, growing up away from all that until he''s ready to take it?" Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, "Yes -- yes, you''re right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?" She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it. " Hagrid''s bringing him." " You think it -- wise -- to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?" I would trust Hagrid with my life," said Dumbledore. " I''m not saying his heart isn''t in the right place," said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, "but you can''t pretend he''s not careless. He does tend to -- what was that?" A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky -- and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them. If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild - long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets. " Hagrid," said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. " At last. And where did you get that motorcycle?" " Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sit," said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. " Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I''ve got him, sir." " No problems, were there?" " No, sir -- house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin'' around. He fell asleep as we was flyin'' over Bristol." Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning. " Is that where -?" whispered Professor McGonagall. " Yes," said Dumbledore. " He''ll have that scar forever." " Couldn''t you do something about it, Dumbledore?" " Even if I could, I wouldn''t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well -- give him here, Hagrid -- we''d better get this over with." Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys'' house. " Could I -- could I say good-bye to him, sir?" asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog. " Shhh!" hissed Professor McGonagall, "you''ll wake the Muggles!" " S-s-sorry," sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. " But I c-c-can''t stand it -- Lily an'' James dead -- an'' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles -" "Yes, yes, it''s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we''ll be found," Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry''s blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid''s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore''s eyes seemed to have gone out. " Well," said Dumbledore finally, "that''s that. We''ve no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations." " Yeah," said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, "I''ll be takin'' Sirius his bike back. G''night, Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore, sir."

Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply. Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four. \" Good luck, Harry,\" he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone. A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours'' time by Mrs. Dursley''s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley... He couldn''t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: \"To Harry Potter -- the boy who lived!\"</Body>\n        </Block>\n    </Chapter>\n    <Chapter id=\"2\" title=\"CHAPTER TWO THE VANISHING GLASS.\">\n        <Block>\n            <Body>Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys'' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -- but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too. Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day. \" Up! Get up! Now!\" Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again. \" Up!\" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he''d had the same dream before. His aunt was back outside the door. \" Are you up yet?\" she demanded. \" Nearly,\" said Harry. \" Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don''t you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy''s birthday.\" Harry groaned. \" What did you say?\" his aunt snapped through the door. \" Nothing, nothing...\" Dudley''s birthday -- how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley''s birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike.

Dudley''s favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn''t often catch him. Harry didn''t look it, but he was very fast. Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley''s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it. " In the car crash when your parents died," she had said. " And don''t ask questions." Don''t ask questions -- that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon. " Comb your hair!" he barked, by way of a morning greeting. About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way -- all over the place. Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel -- Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig. Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn''t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell. " Thirty-six," he said, looking up at his mother and father. " That''s two less than last year." " Darling, you haven''t counted Auntie Marge''s present, see, it''s here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy." " All right, thirty-seven then," said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over. Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, "And we''ll buy you another two presents while we''re out today. How''s that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right'''' Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, "So I''ll have thirty ... thirty..." "Thirty-nine, sweetums," said Aunt Petunia. " Oh." Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. " All right then." Uncle Vernon chuckled. " Little tyke wants his money''s worth, just like his father. '' Atta boy, Dudley!" He ruffled Dudley''s hair. At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried. " Bad news, Vernon," she said. " Mrs. Figg''s broken her leg. She can''t take him." She jerked her head in Harry''s direction. Dudley''s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry''s heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley''s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she''d ever owned.

" We could phone Marge," Uncle Vernon suggested. " Don''t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy." The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn''t there -- or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn''t understand them, like a slug. " What about what''s-her-name, your friend -- Yvonne?" " On vacation in Majorca," snapped Aunt Petunia. " You could just leave me here," Harry put in hopefully (he''d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley''s computer). Aunt Petunia looked as though she''d just swallowed a lemon. " And come back and find the house in ruins?" she snarled. " I won''t blow up the house," said Harry, but they weren''t listening. " I suppose we could take him to the zoo," said Aunt Petunia slowly, "... and leave him in the car...." "That car''s new, he''s not sitting in it alone...." Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn''t really crying -- it had been years since he''d really cried -- but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted. " Dinky Duddydums, don''t cry, Mummy won''t let him spoil your special day!" she cried, flinging her arms around him. " I... don''t... want... him... t-t-to come!" Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. " He always sp- spoils everything!" He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother''s arms. Just then, the doorbell rang -- "Oh, good Lord, they''re here!" said Aunt Petunia frantically -- and a moment later, Dudley''s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people''s arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once. Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn''t believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys'' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn''t been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they''d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside. " I''m warning you," he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry''s, "I''m warning you now, boy -- any funny business, anything at all -- and you''ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas." " I''m not going to do anything," said Harry, "honestly.. But Uncle Vernon didn''t believe him. No one ever did. The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn''t make them happen. Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn''t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left "to hide that horrible scar." Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn''t explain how it had grown back so quickly. Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley''s (brown with orange puff balls) -- The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn''t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn''t punished. On the other hand, he''d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens.

But all he''d tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid- jump. But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn''t school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg''s cabbage-smelling living room. While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles. " ... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums," he said, as a motorcycle overtook them. I had a dream about a motorcycle," said Harry, remembering suddenly. " It was flying." Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: "MOTORCYCLES DON''T FLY!" Dudley and Piers sniggered. I know they don''t," said Harry. " It was only a dream." But he wished he hadn''t said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn''t, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon -- they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas. It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn''t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn''t blond. Harry had the best morning he''d had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn''t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn''t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first. Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last. After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon''s car and crushed it into a trash can -- but at the moment it didn''t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep. Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils. " Make it move," he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn''t budge. " Do it again," Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. " This is boring," Dudley moaned. He shuffled away. Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn''t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself -- no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house. The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry''s. It winked. Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren''t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.

" I know," Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn''t sure the snake could hear him. " It must be really annoying." The snake nodded vigorously. " Where do you come from, anyway?" Harry asked. The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it. Boa Constrictor, Brazil. " Was it nice there?" The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. " Oh, I see -- so you''ve never been to Brazil?" As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump. " DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON''T BELIEVE WHAT IT''S DOING!" Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could. " Out of the way, you," he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor''s tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, "Brazil, here I come.... Thanksss, amigo." The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. " But the glass," he kept saying, "where did the glass go?" The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn''t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon''s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, "Harry was talking to it, weren''t you, Harry?" Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, "Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals," before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy. Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn''t know what time it was and he couldn''t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn''t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food. He''d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he''d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn''t remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burn- ing pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn''t imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn''t remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house. When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all t', NULL);

By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches. Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley''s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley''s favorite sport: Harry Hunting. This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn''t be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon''s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny. \" They stuff people''s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,\" he told Harry. \" Want to come upstairs and practice?\" \" No, thanks,\" said Harry. \" The poor toilet''s never had anything as horrible as your head down it -- it might be sick.\" Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he''d said. One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg''s. Mrs. Figg wasn ''t as bad as usual. It turned out she''d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn''t seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she''d had it for several years. That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings'' boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren''t looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life. As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn''t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn''t trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh. There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water. \" What''s this?\" he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question. \" Your new school uniform,\" she said. Harry looked in the bowl again. \" Oh,\" he said, \"I didn''t realize it had to be so wet.\" \" DotA be stupid,\" snapped Aunt Petunia. \" I''m dyeing some of Dudley''s old things gray for you. It''ll look just like everyone else''s when I''ve finished.\" Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High -- like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably. Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry''s new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelt'), NULL);

" Get the mail, Dudley," said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper. " Make Harry get it." " Get the mail, Harry." " Make Dudley get it." " Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley." Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon''s sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and -- a letter for Harry. Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives -- he didn''t belong to the library, so he''d never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake: Mr. H. Potter The Cupboard under the Stairs 4 Privet Drive Little Whinging Surrey The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp. Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H. "Hurry up, boy!" shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. " What are you doing, checking for letter bombs?" He chuckled at his own joke. Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope. Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard. " Marge''s ill," he informed Aunt Petunia. " Ate a funny whelk. --." " Dad!" said Dudley suddenly. " Dad, Harry''s got something!" Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon. " That''s mine!" said Harry, trying to snatch it back. " Who''d be writing to you?" sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn''t stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge. " P-P-Petunia!" he gasped. Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise. " Vernon! Oh my goodness -- Vernon!" They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn''t used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick. " I want to read that letter," he said loudly. want to read it," said Harry furiously, "as it''s mine." " Get out, both of you," croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope. Harry didn''t move. I WANT MY LETTER!" he shouted. " Let me see it!" demanded Dudley. " OUT!" roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor. " Vernon," Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, "look at the address -- how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don''t think they''re watching the house?" " Watching -- spying -- might be following us," muttered Uncle Vernon wildly. " But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don''t want --" Harry could see Uncle Vernon''s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen. " No," he said finally. " No, we''ll ignore it. If they don''t get an answer... Yes, that''s best... we won''t do anything.... "But --" "I''m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn''t we swear when we took h', NULL);

That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he''d never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard. " Where''s my letter?" said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. " Who''s writing to me?" " No one. it was addressed to you by mistake," said Uncle Vernon shortly. " I have burned it." " It was not a mistake," said Harry angrily, "it had my cupboard on it." " SILENCE!" yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful. " Er -- yes, Harry -- about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking... you''re really getting a bit big for it... we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley''s second bedroom. " Why?" said Harry. " Don''t ask questions!" snapped his uncle. " Take this stuff upstairs, now." The Dursleys'' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon''s sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn''t fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor''s dog; in the corner was Dudley''s first-ever television set, which he''d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though they''d never been touched. From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I don''t want him in there... I need that room... make him get out...." Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he''d have given anything to be up here. Today he''d rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it. Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. He''d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn''t have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he''d opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly. When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, "There''s another one! '' Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive --''" With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry''s letter clutched in his hand. " Go to your cupboard -- I mean, your bedroom," he wheezed at Harry. " Dudley -- go -- just go." Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn''t received his first letter. Surely that meant they''d try again? And this time he''d make sure they didn''t fail. He had a plan. The repaired alarm clock rang at six o''clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn''t wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights. He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first.

Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle''s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn''t do exactly what he''d been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon''s lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink. I want --" he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes. Uncle Vernon didnt go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot. " See," he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, "if they can''t deliver them they''ll just give up." " I''m not sure that''ll work, Vernon." " Oh, these people''s minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they''re not like you and me," said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him. On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn''t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom. Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed "Tiptoe Through the Tulips" as he worked, and jumped at small noises. On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor. " Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?" Dudley asked Harry in amazement. On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy. " No post on Sundays," he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, "no damn letters today --" Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one. " Out! OUT!" Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor. " That does it," said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. I want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We''re going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!" He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag. They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn''t dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while. " Shake''em off... shake ''em off," he would mutter whenever he did this. They didn''t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. He''d never had such a bad day in his life.

Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering.... They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table.

" I''ll take them," said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room. Wouldn''t it be better just to go home, dear?" Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn''t seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage. " Daddy''s gone mad, hasn''t he?" Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared. It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dud ley sniveled. " It''s Monday," he told his mother. " The Great Humberto''s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television. " Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday -- and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of television -- then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry''s eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun -- last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon''s old socks. Still, you weren''t eleven every day. Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn''t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he''d bought. " Found the perfect place!" he said. " Come on! Everyone out!" It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there. " Storm forecast for tonight!" said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. " And this gentleman''s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!" A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them. " I''ve already got us some rations," said Uncle Vernon, "so all aboard!" It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house. The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms. Uncle Vernon''s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up. " Could do with some of those letters now, eh?" he said cheerfully. He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn''t cheer him up at all. As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows.

Dudley''s snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley''s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he''d be eleven in ten minutes'' time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now. Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside.

He was holding a rifle in his hands -- now they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them. \" Who''s there?\" he shouted. \" I warn you -- I''m armed!\" There was a pause. Then -- SMASH! The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor. A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair. The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all. \" Couldn''t make us a cup o'' tea, could yeh? It''s not been an easy journey...\" He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear. \" Budge up, yeh great lump,\" said the stranger. Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon. \" An'' here''s Harry!\" said the giant. Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile. \" Las'' time I saw you, you was only a baby,\" said the giant. \" Yeh look a lot like yet dad, but yeh''ve got yet mom''s eyes.\" Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise. I demand that you leave at once, sit!\" he said. \" You are breaking and entering!\" \" Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,\" said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon''s hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room. Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on. \" Anyway -- Harry,\" said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, \"a very happy birthday to yeh.

Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing. Harry looked up at the giant.

His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn''t see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he''d sunk into a hot bath. The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, "Don''t touch anything he gives you, Dudley." The giant chuckled darkly. " Yet great puddin'' of a son don'' need fattenin'' anymore, Dursley, don'' worry." He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn''t take his eyes off the giant.

" All what?" asked Harry. " ALL WHAT?" Hagrid thundered. " Now wait jus'' one second!" He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against the wall. " Do you mean ter tell me," he growled at the Dursleys, "that this boy -- this boy! -- knows nothin'' abou'' -- about ANYTHING?" Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren''t bad. " I know some things," he said. " I can, you know, do math and stuff." But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, "About our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents'' world." " What world?" Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode. " DURSLEY!" he boomed. Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like "Mimblewimble." Hagrid stared wildly at Harry. " But yeh must know about yet mom and dad," he said. " I mean, they''re famous. You''re famous." " What? My -- my mom and dad weren''t famous, were they?" " Yeh don'' know... yeh don'' know..." Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare. " Yeh don'' know what yeh are?" he said finally. Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice. " Stop!" he commanded. " Stop right there, sit! I forbid you to tell the boy anything!" A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage. " You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An'' you''ve kept it from him all these years?" " Kept what from me?" said Harry eagerly. " STOP! I FORBID YOU!" yelled Uncle Vernon in panic. Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror. " Ah, go boil yet heads, both of yeh," said Hagrid. " Harry -- yet a wizard." There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind could be hear', NULL);

" A wizard, o'' course," said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, "an'' a thumpin'' good''un, I''d say, once yeh''ve been trained up a bit. With a mum an'' dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An'' I reckon it''s abou'' time yeh read yer letter." Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read: HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE (Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards) Dear Mr. Potter, We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31. Yours sincerely, Minerva McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress Questions exploded inside Harry''s head like fireworks and he couldn''t decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, "What does it mean, they await my owl?" " Gallopin'' Gorgons, that reminds me," said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl -- a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl -- a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: Dear Professor Dumbledore, Given Harry his letter. Taking him to buy his things tomorrow. Weather''s horrible. Hope you''re Well. Hagrid Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone. Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly. " Where was I?" said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight. " He''s not going," he said. Hagrid grunted. " I''d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him," he said. " A what?" said Harry, interested. " A Muggle," said Hagrid, "it''s what we call nonmagic folk like thern. An'' it''s your bad luck you grew up in a family o'' the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on." " We swore when we took him in we''d put a stop to that rubbish," said Uncle Vernon, "swore we''d stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!" " You knew?" said Harry. " You knew I''m a -- a wizard?" " Knew!" shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. " Knew! Of course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that-that school-and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was -- a freak! But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family!" She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years. " Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew you''d be just the same, just as strange, just as -- as -- abnormal -- and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!" Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, "Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash!" " CAR CRASH!" roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. " How could a car crash kill Lily an'' James Potter? It''s an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin'' his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!" " But why? What happened?" Harry asked urgently. The anger faded from Hagrid''s face. He looked suddenly anxious. " I never expected this," he said, in a low, worried voice. " I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin'' hold of yeh, how much yeh didn''t know. Ah, Har', NULL);

He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys. " Well, it''s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh -- mind, I can''t tell yeh everythin'', it''s a great myst''ry, parts of it...." He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, "It begins, I suppose, with -- with a person called -- but it''s incredible yeh don''t know his name, everyone in our world knows --" "Who? " " Well -- I don'' like sayin'' the name if I can help it. No one does." " Why not?" " Gulpin'' gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went... bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was..." Hagrid gulped, but no words came out. " Could you write it down?" Harry suggested. " Nah -can''t spell it. All right -- Voldemort. " Hagrid shuddered. " Don'' make me say it again. Anyway, this -- this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin'' fer followers. Got ''em, too -- some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o'' his power, ''cause he was gettin'' himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn''t know who ter trust, didn''t dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches... terrible things happened. He was takin'' over. '' Course, some stood up to him -- an'' he killed ''em. Horribly. One o'' the only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore''s the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn''t dare try takin'' the school, not jus'' then, anyway. " Now, yer mum an'' dad were as good a witch an'' wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an'' girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst''ry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get ''em on his side before... probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin'' ter do with the Dark Side. " Maybe he thought he could persuade ''em... maybe he just wanted ''em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer house an'' -- an'' --" Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn. " Sorry," he said. " But it''s that sad -- knew yer mum an'' dad, an'' nicer people yeh couldn''t find -- anyway..." "You-Know-Who killed ''em. An'' then -- an'' this is the real myst''ry of the thing -- he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin'' by then. But he couldn''t do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That''s what yeh get when a Powerful, evil curse touches yeh -- took care of yer mum an'' dad an'' yer house, even -- but it didn''t work on you, an'' that''s why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill ''em, no one except you, an'' he''d killed some o'' the best witches an'' wizards of the age -- the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts -- an'' you was only a baby, an'' you lived." Something very painful was going on in Harry''s mind. As Hagrid''s story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before -- and he remembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh. Hagrid was watching him sadly. " Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore''s orders. Brought yeh ter this lot..." "Load of old tosh," said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched. " Now, you listen here, boy," he snarled, "I accept there''s something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn''t have cured -- and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, and the world''s better off without them in my opinion -- asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types -- just what I expected, always knew they''d come to a sticky end --" But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and ', NULL);

Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, "I''m warning you, Dursley -I''m warning you -- one more word... " In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon''s courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent. " That''s better," said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor. Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them. " But what happened to Vol--, sorry -- I mean, You-Know-Who?" " Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That''s the biggest myst''ry, see... he was gettin'' more an'' more powerful -- why''d he go? " Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he''s still out there, bidin'' his time, like, but I don'' believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of ''em came outta kinda trances. Don~ reckon they could''ve done if he was comin'' back. " Most of us reckon he''s still out there somewhere but lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. ''Cause somethin'' about you finished him, Harry. There was somethin'' goin'' on that night he hadn''t counted on -- I dunno what it was, no one does -- but somethin'' about you stumped him, all right." Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He''d spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn''t they been turned into warty toads every time they''d tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he''d once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football? " Hagrid," he said quietly, "I think you must have made a mistake. I don''t think I can be a wizard." To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled. " Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or angry?" Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it... every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry... chased by Dudley''s gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach... dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he''d managed to make it grow back... and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn''t he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn''t he set a boa constrictor on him? Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him. " See?" said Hagrid. " Harry Potter, not a wizard -- you wait, you''ll be right famous at Hogwarts." But Uncle Vernon wasn''t going to give in without a fight. " Haven''t I told you he''s not going?" he hissed. " He''s going to Stonewall High and he''ll be grateful for it. I''ve read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish -- spell books and wands and --" "If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won''t stop him," growled Hagrid. " Stop Lily an'' James Potter'' s son goin'' ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name''s been down ever since he was born. He''s off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won''t know himself. He''ll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an'' he''ll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had Albus Dumbled--" "I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL To TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!" yelled Uncle Vernon. But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head, "NEVER," he thundered, "- INSULT- ALBUS- DUMBLEDORE- IN- FRONT- OF- ME!" He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley -- there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain.

When I open my eyes I''ll be at home in my cupboard.\" There was suddenly a loud tapping noise. And there''s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart sinking. But he still didn''t open his eyes. It had been such a good dream. Tap. Tap. Tap. \" All right,\" Harry mumbled, \"I''m getting up.\" He sat up and Hagrid''s heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak. Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn''t wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid''s coat. \" Don''t do that.\" Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat. \" Hagrid!\" said Harry loudly. \" There''s an owl \"Pay him,\" Hagrid grunted into the sofa. \" What?\" \" He wants payin'' fer deliverin'' the paper. Look in the pockets.\" Hagrid''s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets -- bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags... finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins. \" Give him five Knuts,\" said Hagrid sleepily. \" Knuts?\" \" The little bronze ones.\" Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off through the open window. Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched. \" Best be Off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an'' buy all yer stuff fer school.\" Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture. \" Um -- Hagrid?\" \" Mm?\" said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots. \" I haven''t got any money -- and you heard Uncle Vernon last night ... he won''t pay for me to go and learn magic.\" \" Don''t worry about that,\" said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head. \" D''yeh think yer parents didn''t leave yeh anything?\" \" But if their house was destroyed --\" \"They didn'' keep their gold i'), NULL);

Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding. " Goblins?" " Yeah -- so yeh''d be mad ter try an'' rob it, I''ll tell yeh that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe -- ''cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o'' fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business." Hagrid drew himself up proudly. " He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin'' you gettin'' things from Gringotts -- knows he can trust me, see. " Got everythin''? Come on, then." Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm. " How did you get here?" Harry asked, looking around for another boat. " Flew," said Hagrid. " Flew?" " Yeah -- but we''ll go back in this. Not s''pposed ter use magic now I''ve got yeh." They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying. " Seems a shame ter row, though," said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks. " If I was ter -- er -- speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin'' it at Hogwarts?" " Of course not," said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land. " Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?" Harry asked. " Spells -- enchantments," said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. " They say there''s dragons guardin'' the highsecurity vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way -- Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh''d die of hunger tryin'' ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat." Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he''d never had so many questions in his life. " Ministry o'' Magic messin'' things up as usual," Hagrid muttered, turning the page. " There''s a Ministry of Magic?" Harry asked, before he could stop himself. "'' Course," said Hagrid. " They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, 0 '' course, but he''d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin'' fer advice." " But what does a Ministry of Magic do?" " Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there''s still witches an'' wizards up an'' down the country." " Why?" " Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone''d be wantin'' magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we''re best left alone." At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street. Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station. Harry couldn''t blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, "See that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?" " Hagrid," said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, "did you say there are dragons at Gringotts?" " Well, so they say," said Hagrid. " Crikey, I''d like a dragon." " You''d like one?" " Wanted one ever since I was a kid -- here we go." They had reached the station. There was a train to London in five minutes'' time. Hagrid, who didn''t understand "Muggle money," as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets. People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent. " Still got yer letter, Harry?" he asked as he counted stitches. Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.', NULL);

Harry wondered aloud. " If yeh know where to go," said Hagrid. Harry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow. " I don''t know how the Muggles manage without magic," he said as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops. Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn''t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn''t help trusting him. " This is it," said Hagrid, coming to a halt, "the Leaky Cauldron. It''s a famous place." It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn''t pointed it out, Harry wouldn''t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn''t glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn''t see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside. For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, "The usual, Hagrid?" " Can''t, Tom, I''m on Hogwarts business," said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry''s shoulder and making Harry''s knees buckle. " Good Lord," said the bartender, peering at Harry, "is this -- can this be --?" The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent. " Bless my soul," whispered the old bartender, "Harry Potter... what an honor." He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes. " Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back." Harry didn''t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming. Then there wa', NULL);

" Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can''t believe I''m meeting you at last." " So proud, Mr. Potter, I''m just so proud." " Always wanted to shake your hand -- I''m all of a flutter." " Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can''t tell you, Diggle''s the name, Dedalus Diggle." " I''ve seen you before!" said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle''s top hat fell off in his excitement. " You bowed to me once in a shop." " He remembers!" cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. " Did you hear that? He remembers me!" Harry shook hands again and again -- Doris Crockford kept coming back for more. A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was twitching. " Professor Quirrell!" said Hagrid. " Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts." " P-P-Potter," stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry''s hand, "c-can''t t-tell you how p- pleased I am to meet you." " What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?" " D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts," muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he''d rather not think about it. " N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?" He laughed nervously. " You''ll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I''ve g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself." He looked terrified at the very thought. But the others wouldn''t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble. " Must get on -- lots ter buy. Come on, Harry." Doris Crockford shook Harry''s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds. Hagrid grinned at Harry. " Told yeh, didn''t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin'' ter meet yeh -- mind you, he''s usually tremblin''." " Is he always that nervous?" " Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyin'' outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience.... They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o'' trouble with a hag -- never been the same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own subject now, where''s me umbrella?" Vampires? Hags? Harry''s head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can. " Three up... two across he muttered. " Right, stand back, Harry." He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella. The brick he had touched quivered -- it wriggled -- in the middle, a small hole appeared -- it grew wider and wider -- a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight. " Welcome," said Hagrid, "to Diagon Alley." He grinned at Harry''s amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall. The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons -- All Sizes - Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver -- Self-Stirring -- Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them. " Yeah, you''ll be needin'' one," said Hagrid, "but we gotta get yer money first." Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, "Dragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they''re mad...." A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium -- Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy.

"Gringotts," said Hagrid. They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was - "Yeah, that''s a goblin," said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them: Enter, stranger, but take heed Of what awaits the sin of greed, For those who take, but do not earn, Must pay most dearly in their turn. So if you seek beneath our floors A treasure that was never yours, Thief, you have been warned, beware Of finding more than treasure there. " Like I said, Yeh''d be mad ter try an'' rob it," said Hagrid. A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter. " Morning," said Hagrid to a free goblin. " We''ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter''s safe." " You have his key, Sir?" " Got it here somewhere," said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblin''s book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals. " Got it," said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key. The goblin looked at it closely. " That seems to be in order." " An'' I''ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore," said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. " It''s about the YouKnow-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen." The goblin read the letter carefully. " Very well," he said, handing it back to Hagrid, "I will have Someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!" Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall. " What''s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?" Harry asked. " Can''t tell yeh that," said Hagrid mysteriously. " Very secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore''s trusted me. More''n my job''s worth ter tell yeh that." Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in -- Hagrid with some difficulty -- and were off. At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn''t steering. Harry''s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late - - they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor. I never know," Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, "what''s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?" " Stalagmite''s got an ''m'' in it," said Hagrid. " An'' don'' ask me questions just now, I think I''m gonna be sick." He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small d', NULL);

A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts. " All yours," smiled Hagrid. All Harry''s -- it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn''t have known about this or they''d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London. Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag. " The gold ones are Galleons," he explained. " Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it''s easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o'' terms, we''ll keep the rest safe for yeh." He turned to Griphook. " Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?" " One speed only," said Griphook. They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck. Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole. " Stand back," said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away. " If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they''d be sucked through the door and trapped in there," said Griphook. " How often do you check to see if anyone''s inside?" Harry asked. " About once every ten years," said Griphook with a rather nasty grin. Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least -- but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask. " Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don''t talk to me on the way back, it''s best if I keep me mouth shut," said Hagrid. One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn''t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He didn''t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he''d had in his whole life -- more money than even Dudley had ever had. " Might as well get yer uniform," said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin''s Robes for All Occasions. " Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts." He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin''s shop alone, feeling nervous. Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve. " Hogwarts, clear?" she said, when Harry started to speak. " Got the lot here -- another young man being fitted up just now, in fact. " In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him) slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length. " Hello," said the boy, "Hogwarts, too?" " Yes," said Harry. " My father''s next door buying my books and mother''s up the street looking at wands," said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. " Then I''m going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don''t see why first years can''t have their own. I think I''ll bully father into getting me one and I''ll smuggle it in somehow." Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley. " Have you got your own broom?" the boy went on. " No," said Harry. " Play Quidditch at all?" " No," Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be. " I do -- Father says it''s a crime if I''m not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know', NULL);

" Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I''ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been -- imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I''d leave, wouldn''t you?" " Mmm," said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting. " I say, look at that man!" said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn''t come in. " That''s Hagrid," said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn''t. " He works at Hogwarts." " Oh," said the boy, "I''ve heard of him. He''s a sort of servant, isn''t he?" " He''s the gamekeeper," said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second. " Yes, exactly. I heard he''s a sort of savage -- lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed." " I think he''s brilliant," said Harry coldly. " Do you?" said the boy, with a slight sneer. " Why is he with you? Where are your parents?" " They''re dead," said Harry shortly. He didn''t feel much like going into the matter with this boy. " Oh, sorry," said the other,. not sounding sorry at all. " But they were our kind, weren''t they?" " They were a witch and wizard, if that''s what you mean." " I really don''t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They''re just not the same, they''ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What''s your surname, anyway?" But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, "That''s you done, my dear," and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool. " Well, I''ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose," said the drawling boy. Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts). " What''s up?" said Hagrid. " Nothing," Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, "Hagrid, what''s Quidditch?" " Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin'' how little yeh know -- not knowin'' about Quidditch!" " Don''t make me feel worse," said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pate boy in Madam Malkin''s. " --and he said people from Muggle families shouldn''t even be allowed in." " Yer not from a Muggle family. If he''d known who yeh were -- he''s grown up knowin'' yer name if his parents are wizardin'' folk. You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know about it, some o'' the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in ''em in a long line 0'' Muggles -- look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!" " So what is Quidditch?" " It''s our sport. Wizard sport. It''s like -- like soccer in the Muggle world -- everyone follows Quidditch -- played up in the air on broomsticks and there''s four balls -- sorta hard ter explain the rules." " And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?" " School houses. There''s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o'' duffers, but --" "I bet I''m in Hufflepuff" said Harry gloomily. " Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin," said Hagrid darkly. " There''s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn''t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one." " Vol-, sorry - You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?" " Years an'' years ago," said Hagrid. They bought Harry''s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest ', NULL);

" I''m not sayin'' that''s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances," said Hagrid. " An'' anyway, yeh couldn'' work any of them curses yet, yeh''ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level." Hagrid wouldn''t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either ("It says pewter on yer list"), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop). Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry''s list again. " Just yer wand left - A yeah, an'' I still haven''t got yeh a birthday present." Harry felt himself go red. " You don''t have to --" "I know I don''t have to. Tell yeh what, I''ll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh''d be laughed at - an'' I don'' like cats, they make me sneeze. I''ll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they''re dead useful, carry yer mail an'' everythin''." Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn''t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell. " Don'' mention it," said Hagrid gruffly. " Don'' expect you''ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now - only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand." A magic wand... this was what Harry had been really looking forward to. The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window. A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic. " Good afternoon," said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair. An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop. " Hello," said Harry awkwardly. " Ah yes," said the man. " Yes, yes. I thought I''d be seeing you soon. Harry Potter." It wasn''t a question. " You have your mother''s eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work." Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy. " Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it -- it''s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course." Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes. " And that''s where..." Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry''s forehead with a long, white', NULL);

Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands... well, if I''d known what that wand was going out into the world to do...." He shook his head and then, to Harry''s relief, spotted Hagrid. " Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again.... Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn''t it?" " It was, sir, yes," said Hagrid. " Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?" said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern. " Er -- yes, they did, yes," said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. " I''ve still got the pieces, though," he added brightly. " But you don''t use them?" said Mr. Ollivander sharply. " Oh, no, sit," said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke. " Hmmm," said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. " Well, now -- Mr. Potter. Let me see." He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. " Which is your wand arm?" " Er -- well, I''m right-handed," said Harry. " Hold out your arm. That''s it." He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, "Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard''s wand." Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes. " That will do," he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor. " Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it a wave." Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once. " Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try --" Harry tried -- but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander. " No, no -here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out." Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become. " Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we''ll find the perfect match here somewhere -- I wonder, now - - yes, why not -- unusual combination -- holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple." Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, "Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well... how curious... how very curious... " He put Harry''s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, "Curious... curious.. " Sorry," said Harry, "but what''s curious?" Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare. " I remember every wand I''ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather -- just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother why, its brother gave you that scar." Harry swallowed. " Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember.... I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter....

The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn''t speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn''t even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry''s lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder. \" Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,\" he said. He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow. \" You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,\" said Hagrid. Harry wasn''t sure he could explain. He''d just had the best birthday of his life -- and yet -- he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words. \" Everyone thinks I''m special,\" he said at last. \" All those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander... but I don''t know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I''m famous and I can''t even remember what I''m famous for.

Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she''ll know where to find me.... See yeh soon, Harry.\" The train pulled out of the station.

True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn''t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn''t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him -- in fact, they didn''t speak to him at all. Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while. Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn''t come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first. On the last day of August he thought he''d better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King''s Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room. \" Er -- Uncle Vernon?\" Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening. \" Er -- I need to be at King''s Cross tomorrow to -- to go to Hogwarts.\" Uncle Vernon grunted again. \" Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?\" Grunt.

" Where is this school, anyway?" " I don''t know," said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket. " I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o''clock," he read. His aunt and uncle stared. " Platform what?" " Nine and three-quarters." " Don''t talk rubbish," said Uncle Vernon. " There is no platform nine and three-quarters." " It''s on my ticket." " Barking," said Uncle Vernon, "howling mad, the lot of them. You''ll see. You just wait. All right, we''ll take you to King''s Cross. We''re going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn''t bother." " Why are you going to London?" Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly. " Taking Dudley to the hospital," growled Uncle Vernon. " Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings." Harry woke at five o''clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn''t want to walk into the station in his wizard''s robes -- he''d change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry''s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys'' car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off. They reached King''s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry''s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face. " Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine -- platform ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don''t seem to have built it yet, do they?" He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all. " Have a good term," said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing. Harry''s mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He''d have to ask someone. He stopped a passing guard, but didn''t dare mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn''t even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o''clock, but the guard said there wasn''t one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl. Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector''s stand between platforms nine and ten. At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying. " -- packed with Muggles, of course --" Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry''s in front of him -- and they had an owl. Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying. " Now, what''s the platform number?" said the boys'' mother.

What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten. Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it -- but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished. " Fred, you next," the plump woman said. " I''m not Fred, I''m George," said the boy. " Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? CarA you tell I''m George?" " Sorry, George, dear." " Only joking, I am Fred," said the boy, and off he went. His twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had gone -- but how had he done it? Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there -- and then, quite suddenly, he wasn''t anywhere. There was nothing else for it. " Excuse me," Harry said to the plump woman. " Hello, dear," she said. " First time at Hogwarts? Ron''s new, too." She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose. " Yes," said Harry. " The thing is -- the thing is, I don''t know how to --" "How to get onto the platform?" she said kindly, and Harry nodded. " Not to worry," she said. " All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don''t stop and don''t be scared you''ll crash into it, that''s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you''re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron." " Er -- okay," said Harry. He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very solid. He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he''d be in trouble -- leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run -- the barrier was coming nearer and nearer -- he wouldn''t be able to stop -- the cart was out of control -- he was a foot away -- he closed his eyes ready for the crash -- It didn''t come... he kept on running... he opened his eyes. A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven O''clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it, He had done it. Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks. The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, "Gran, I''ve lost my toad again." " Oh, Neville," he heard the old woman sigh. A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd. " Give us a look, Lee, go on." The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg. Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot. " Want a hand?" It was one of the red-haired twins he''d followed through the barrier. " Yes, please," Harry panted. " Oy, Fred! C''mere and help!" With the twins'' help, Harry''s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment. " Thanks," said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes. " What''s that?" said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry''s lightning scar. " Blimey," said the other twin. " Are you "He is," said the first twin. " Aren''t you?" he added to', NULL);

The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train''s open door. " Fred? George? Are you there?" " Coming, Mom." With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train. Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief. " Ron, you''ve got something on your nose." The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose. " Mom -- geroff" He wriggled free. " Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?" said one of the twins. " Shut up," said Ron. " Where''s Percy?" said their mother. " He''s coming now." The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his chest with the letter P on it. " Can''t stay long, Mother," he said. " I''m up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves --" "Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?" said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise. " You should have said something, we had no idea." " Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it," said the other twin. " Once --" "Or twice --" "A minute --" "All summer --" "Oh, shut up," said Percy the Prefect. " How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?" said one of the twins. " Because he''s a prefect," said their mother fondly. " All right, dear, well, have a good term -- send me an owl when you get there." She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins. " Now, you two -- this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you''ve -- you''ve blown up a toilet or --" "Blown up a toilet? We''ve never blown up a toilet." " Great idea though, thanks, Mom." " It''s not funny. And look after Ron." " Don''t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us." " Shut up," said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it. " Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?" Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn''t see him looking. " You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who he is?" " Who?" " Harry Potter!" Harry heard the little girl''s voice. " Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please...." "You''ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn''t something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?" " Asked him. Saw his scar. It''s really there - like lightning." " Poor dear - no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform." " Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like?" Their mother suddenly became very stern. " I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don''t you dare. As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school." " All right, keep your hair on." A whistle sounded. " Hurry up!" their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and their younger sister began to cry. " Don''t, Ginny, we''ll send you loads of owls." " We''ll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat." " George!" " Only joking, Mom." The train began to move. Harry saw the boys'' mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved. Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He didn''t know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind. The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in. " Anyone sitting there?" he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry. " Everywhere else is full." Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. H', NULL);

The twins were back. " Listen, we''re going down the middle of the train -- Lee Jordan''s got a giant tarantula down there." " Right," mumbled Ron. " Harry," said the other twin, "did we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then. " Bye," said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them. " Are you really Harry Potter?" Ron blurted out. Harry nodded. " Oh -well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George''s jokes," said Ron. " And have you really got -- you know..." He pointed at Harry''s forehead. Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared. " So that''s where You-Know-Who "Yes," said Harry, "but I can''t remember it." " Nothing?" said Ron eagerly. " Well -- I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else." " Wow," said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again. " Are all your family wizards?" asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him. " Er -- Yes, I think so," said Ron. " I think Mom''s got a second cousin who''s an accountant, but we never talk about him." " So you must know loads of magic already." The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about. " I heard you went to live with Muggles," said Ron. " What are they like?" " Horrible -well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I''d had three wizard brothers." " Five," said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. " I''m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I''ve got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left -- Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy''s a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they''re really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it''s no big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I''ve got Bill''s old robes, Charlie''s old wand, and Percy''s old rat." Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep. " His name''s Scabbers and he''s useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn''t aff -- I mean, I got Scabbers instead." Ron''s ears went pink. He seemed to think he''d said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window. Harry didn''t think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, he''d never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley''s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up. " ... and until Hagrid told me, I didn''t know anything about be ing a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort" Ron gasped. " What?" said Harry. " You said You-Know-Who''s name!" said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed. " I''d have thought you, of all people --" "I''m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name," said Harry, I just never knew you shouldn''t. See what I mean? I''ve got loads to learn.... I bet," he added, voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately, "I bet I''m the worst in the class." " You won''t be. There''s loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough." While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London. Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past. Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, "Anything off the cart, dears?" Harry, who hadn''t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron''s ears went pink again and he muttered that he''', NULL);
INSERT INTO SYSTEM_LOB_STREAM VALUES(4, 35, 'd brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the corridor. He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry -- but the woman didn''t have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bettie Bott''s Every Flavor Beans, Drooble''s Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts. Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat. " Hungry, are you?" " Starving," said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty. Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, "She always forgets I don''t like corned beef." " Swap you for one of these," said Harry, holding up a pasty. " Go on --" "You don''t want this, it''s all dry," said Ron. " She hasn''t got much time," he added quickly, "you know, with five of us." " Go on, have a pasty," said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry''s pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten). " What are these?" Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs. " They''re not really frogs, are they?" He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him. " No," said Ron. " But see what the card is. I''m missing Agrippa." " What?" " Oh, of course, you wouldn''t know -- Chocolate Frogs have cards, inside them, you know, to collect -- famous witches and wizards. I''ve got about five hundred, but I haven''t got Agrippa or Ptolemy." Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a man''s face. He wore half- moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore. " So this is Dumbledore!" said Harry. " Don''t tell me you''d never heard of Dumbledore!" said Ron. " Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa -- thanks Harry turned over his card and read: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon''s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling. Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore''s face had disappeared. " He''s gone!" " Well, you can''t expect him to hang around all day," said Ron. " He''ll be back. No, I''ve got Morgana again and I''ve got about six of her... do you want it? You can start collecting." Ron''s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped. " Help yourself," said Harry. " But in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos." " Do they? What, they don''t move at all?" Ron sounded amazed. " weird!" Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn''t keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott''s Every Flavor Beans. " You want to be careful with those," Ron warned Harry. " When they say every flavor, they mean every flavor -- you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar- malade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger- flavored one once." Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner. " Bleaaargh -- s', NULL);

Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn''t touch, which turned out to be pepper. The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills. There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and threequarters came in. He looked tearful. " Sorry," he said, "but have you seen a toad at all?" When they shook their heads, he wailed, "I''ve lost him! He keeps getting away from me!" " He''ll turn up," said Harry. " Yes," said the boy miserably. " Well, if you see him..." He left. " Don''t know why he''s so bothered," said Ron. " If I''d brought a toad I''d lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can''t talk." The rat was still snoozing on Ron''s lap. " He might have died and you wouldn''t know the difference," said Ron in disgust. " I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn''t work. I''ll show you, look..." He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking wand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end. " Unicorn hair''s nearly poking out. Anyway He had just raised his ''wand when the compartment door slid open again. The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes. " Has anyone seen a toad? Neville''s lost one," she said. She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth. " We''ve already told him we haven''t seen it," said Ron, but the girl wasn''t listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand. " Oh, are you doing magic? Let''s see it, then." She sat down. Ron looked taken aback. " Er -- all right." He cleared his throat. " Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow." He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep. " Are you sure that''s a real spell?" said the girl. " Well, it''s not very good, is it? I''ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it''s all worked for me. Nobody in my family''s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it''s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I''ve heard -- I''ve learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough -- I''m Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you. She said all this very fast. Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn''t learned all the course books by heart either. " I''m Ron Weasley," Ron muttered. " Harry Potter," said Harry. " Are you really?" said Hermione. " I know all about you, of course -- I got a few extra books. for background reading, and you''re in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century. " Am I?" said Harry, feeling dazed. " Goodness, didn''t you know, I''d have found out everything I could if it was me," said Hermione. " Do either of you know what house you''ll be in? I''ve been asking around, and I hope I''m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn''t be too bad.... Anyway, we''d better go and look for Neville''s toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we''ll be there soon." And she left, taking the toadless boy with her. " Whatever house I''m in, I hope she''s not in it," said Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk. " Stupid spell -- George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud." " What house are your brothers in?" asked Harry. " Gryffindor," said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. " Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don''t know what they''ll say if I''m not. I don''t suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin." " That''s the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who wa', NULL);

" You know, I think the ends of Scabbers'' whiskers are a bit lighter," said Harry, trying to take Ron''s mind off houses. " So what do your oldest brothers do now that they''ve left, anyway?" Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he''d finished school. " Charlie''s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill''s in Africa doing something for Gringotts," said Ron. " Did you hear about Gringotts? It''s been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don''t suppose you get that with the Muggles -- someone tried to rob a high security vault." Harry stared. " Really? What happened to them?" " Nothing, that''s why it''s such big news. They haven''t been caught. My dad says it must''ve been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don''t think they took anything, that''s what''s odd. '' Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who''s behind it." Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You- Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying "Voldemort" without worrying. " What''s your Quidditch team?" Ron asked. " Er -- I don''t know any," Harry confessed. " What!" Ron looked dumbfounded. " Oh, you wait, it''s the best game in the world --" And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he''d been to with his brothers and the broomstick he''d like to get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn''t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time. Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was the pale boy from Madam Malkin''s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he''d shown back in Diagon Alley. " Is it true?" he said. " They''re saying all down the train that Harry Potter''s in this compartment. So it''s you, is it?" " Yes," said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards. " Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle," said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. " And my name''s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy." Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigget. Draco Malfoy looked at him. " Think my name''s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford." He turned back to Harry. " You''ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don''t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there." He held out his hand to shake Harry''s, but Harry didn''t take it. " I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks," he said coolly. Draco Malfoy didn''t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks. " I''d be careful if I were you, Potter," he said slowly. " Unless you''re a bit politer you''ll go the same way as your parents. They didn''t know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it''ll rub off on you." Both Harry and Ron stood up. " Say that again," Ron said, his face as red as his hair. " Oh, you''re going to fight us, are you?" Malfoy sneered. " Unless you get out now," said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron. " But we don''t feet like leaving, do we, boys? We''ve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some." Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron - Ron leapt forward, but before he''d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell.

Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they''d heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in. " What has been going on?" she said, looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail. I think he''s been knocked out," Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at Scabbers. " No -- I don''t believe it -- he''s gone back to sleep-" And so he had. " You''ve met Malfoy before?" Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley. " I''ve heard of his family," said Ron darkly. " They were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they''d been bewitched. My dad doesn''t believe it. He says Malfoy''s father didn''t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side." He turned to Hermione. " Can we help you with something?" " You''d better hurry up and put your robes on, I''ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we''re nearly there. You haven''t been fighting, have you? You''ll be in trouble before we even get there!" " Scabbers has been fighting, not us," said Ron, scowling at her. " Would you mind leaving while we change?" " All right -- I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors," said Hermione in a sniffy voice. " And you''ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?" Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky. The train did seem to be slowing down. He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes. Ron''s were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them. A voice echoed through the train: "We will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes'' time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately." Harry''s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor. The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: "Firs'' years! Firs'' years over here! All right there, Harry?" Hagrid''s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads. " C''mon, follow me -- any more firs'' years? Mind yer step, now! Firs'' years follow me!" Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice. " Ye'' all get yer firs'' sight o'' Hogwarts in a sec," Hagrid called over his shoulder, "jus'' round this bend here." There was a loud "Oooooh!" The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black take. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers. " No more''n four to a boat!" Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione. " Everyone in?" shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself. " Right then -- FORWARD!" And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood. " Heads down!" yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and peb', NULL);

Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid''s lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle. They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, Oak front door. \" Everyone here?

A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry''s first thought was that this was not someone to cross. \" The firs'' years, Professor McGonagall,\" said Hagrid. \" Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.\" She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys'' house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors. They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right -the rest of the school must already be here -- but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously. \" Welcome to Hogwarts,\" said Professor McGonagall. \" The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room. \" The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours. \" The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.\" Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville''s cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron''s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair. \" I shall return when we are ready for you,\" said Professor McGonagall. \" Please wait quietly.\" She left the chamber. Harry swallowed. \" How exactly do they sort us into houses?\" he asked Ron. \" Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.\" Harry''s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school? But he didn''t know any magic yet -- what on earth would he have to do? He hadn''t expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she''d learned and wondering which one she''d need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He''d never been more nervous, never, not even when he''d had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he''d somehow turned his teacher''s wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom.

Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: "Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance --" "My dear Friar, haven''t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he''s not really even a ghost -- I say, what are you all doing here?" A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years. Nobody answered. " New students!" said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. " About to be Sorted, I suppose?" A few people nodded mutely. " Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!" said the Friar. " My old house, you know." " Move along now," said a sharp voice. " The Sorting Ceremony''s about to start." Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall. " Now, form a line," Professor McGonagall told the first years, "and follow me." Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall. Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, "Its bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History." It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn''t simply open on to the heavens. Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard''s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn''t have let it in the house. Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing -- noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth -- and the hat began to sing: "Oh, you may not think I''m pretty, But don''t judge on what you see, I''ll eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me. You can keep your bowlers black, Your top hats sleek and tall, For I''m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat And I can cap them all. There''s nothing hidden in your head The Sorting Hat can''t see, So try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be. You might belong in Gryffindor, Where dwell the brave at heart, Their daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart; You might belong in Hufflepuff, Where they are just and loyal, Those patient Hufflepuffis are true And unafraid of toil; Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, if you''ve a ready mind, Where those of wit and learning, Will always find their kind; Or perhaps in Slytherin You''ll make your real friends, Those cunning folk use any means To achieve their ends. So put me on! Don''t be afraid! And don''t get in a flap! You''re in safe hands (though I have none) For I''m a Thinking Cap!" The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again. " So we''ve just got to try on the hat!" Ron whispered to Harry. " I''ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a ', NULL);
INSERT INTO SYSTEM_LOB_STREAM VALUES(4, 41, 'troll." Harry. smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather alot; Harry didn''t feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him. Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment. " When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted," she said. " Abbott, Hannah!" A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause -- "HUFFLEPUFF!" shouted the hat. The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her. " Bones, Susan!" " HUFFLEPUFF!" shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah. " Boot, Terry!" " RAVENCLAW!" The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them. " Brocklehurst, Mandy" went to Ravenclaw too, but "Brown, Lavender" became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron''s twin brothers catcalling. " Bulstrode, Millicent" then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry''s imagination, after all he''d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot. He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him. " Finch-Fletchley, Justin!" " HUFFLEPUFF!" Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. " Finnigan, Seamus," the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor. " Granger, Hermione!" Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head. " GRYFFINDOR!" shouted the hat. Ron groaned. A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you''re very nervous. What if he wasn''t chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he''d better get back on the train? When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, "GRYFFINDOR," Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to "MacDougal, Morag." Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, "SLYTHERIN!" Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself. There weren''t many people left now. " Moon" "Nott" "Parkinson" then a pair of twin girls, "Patil" and "Patil" then "Perks, Sally-Anne" and then, at last -- "Potter, Harry!" As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall. " Potter, did she say?" The Harry Potter?" The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited. Hmm," said a small voice in his ear. " Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There''s talent, A my goodness, yes -- and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that''s interesting.... So where shall I put you?" Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin. " Not Slytherin, eh?" said the small voice. " Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it''s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about th', NULL);
INSERT INTO SYSTEM_LOB_STREAM VALUES(4, 42, 'at -- no? Well, if you''re sure -- better be GRYFFINDOR!" Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, "We got Potter! We got Potter!" Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he''d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he''d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water. He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he''d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore''s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirtell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban. And now there were only three people left to be sorted. " Thomas, Dean," a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. " Turpin, Lisa," became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron''s turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, "GRYFFINDOR!" Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him. " Well done, Ron, excellent," said Percy Weasley Pompously across Harry as "Zabini, Blaise," was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away. Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago. Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there. " Welcome," he said. " Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! " Thank you!" He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn''t know whether to laugh or not. " Is he -- a bit mad?" he asked Percy uncertainly. " Mad?" said Percy airily. " He''s a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?" Harry''s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs. The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he''d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious. " That does look good," said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak, "Can''t you --?" I haven''t eaten for nearly four hundred years," said the ghost. " I don''t need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don''t think I''ve in troduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower." " I know who you are!" said Ron suddenly. " My brothers told me about you -- you''re Nearly Headless Nick!" " I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy --" the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted. " Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?" Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn''t going at all the way he wanted. " Like this," he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried', NULL);
INSERT INTO SYSTEM_LOB_STREAM VALUES(4, 43, ' to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, "So -- new Gryffindors! I hope you''re going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron''s becoming almost unbearable -- he''s the Slytherin ghost." Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn''t look too pleased with the seating arrangements. " How did he get covered in blood?" asked Seamus with great interest. " I''ve never asked," said Nearly Headless Nick delicately. When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding -- " As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families. " I''m half-and-half," said Seamus. " Me dad''s a Muggle. Mom didn''t tell him she was a witch ''til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him." The others laughed. " What about you, Neville?" said Ron. " Well, my gran brought me up and she''s a witch," said Neville, "but the family thought I was all- Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me -- he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned -- but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here -- they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad." On Harry''s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons ("I do hope they start right away, there''s so much to learn, I''m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it''s supposed to be very difficult-"; "You''ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing -- "). Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin. It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell''s turban straight into Harry''s eyes -- and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry''s forehead. " Ouch!" Harry clapped a hand to his head. " What is it?" asked Percy. " N-nothing." The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher''s look -- a feeling that he didn''t like Harry at all. " Who''s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?" he asked Percy. " Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he''s looking so nervous, that''s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn''t want to -- everyone knows he''s after Quirrell''s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape." Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn''t look at him again. At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent. " Ahern -- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you. " First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students wou', NULL);

" I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors. " Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch. " And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death." Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did. " He''s not serious?" he muttered to Percy. " Must be," said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. " It''s odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we''re not allowed to go somewhere -- the forest''s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least." " And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!" cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers'' smiles had become rather fixed. Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words. " Everyone pick their favorite tune," said Dumbledore, "and off we go!" And the school bellowed: "Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, Teach us something please, Whether we be old and bald Or young with scabby knees, Our heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff, For now they''re bare and full of air, Dead flies and bits of fluff, So teach us things worth knowing, Bring back what we''ve forgot, just do your best, we''ll do the rest, And learn until our brains all rot. Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest. " Ah, music," he said, wiping his eyes. " A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!" The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry''s legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt. A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him. " Peeves," Percy whispered to the first years. " A poltergeist." He raised his voice, "Peeves -- show yourself" A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered. " Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?" There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross- legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks. " Oooooooh!" he said, with an evil cackle. " Ickle Firsties! What fun!" He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked. " Go away, Peeves, or the Baron''ll hear about this, I mean it!" barked Percy. Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville''s head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed. " You want to watch out for Peeves," said Percy, as they set off again. " The Bloody Baron''s the only one who can control him, he won''t even listen to us prefects. Here we are." At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress. " Password?" she said. " Caput Draconis," said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it -- Neville needed a leg up -- and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, r', NULL);

At the top of a spiral staircase -- they were obviously in one of the towers -- they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed. \" Great food, isn''t it?\" Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. \" Get off, Scabbers! He''s chewing my sheets.\" Harry was going to ask Ron if he''d had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once. Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell''s turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn''t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully -- and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it -then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold -- there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking. He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn''t remember the dream at all.</Body>\n        </Block>\n    </Chapter>\n    <Chapter id=\"8\" title=\"CHAPTER EIGHT THE POTIONS MASTER.\">\n        <Block>\n            <Body>There, look.\" \" Where?\" \" Next to the tall kid with the red hair.\" \" Wearing the glasses?\" \" Did you see his face?\" \" Did you see his scar?\" Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they wouldn''t, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes. There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn''t open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren''t really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk. The ghosts didn''t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, \"GOT YOUR CONK!\" Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He wouldn''t believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing. Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch''s. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she''d whisk off for Filch, who''d appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a g'), NULL);

There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words. They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for. Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up. Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry''s name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight. Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to think she wasn''t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class. " Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts," she said. " Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned." Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldn''t wait to get started, but soon realized they weren''t going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile. The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell''s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he''d met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren''t sure they believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went. Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn''t miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn''t had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn''t have much of a head start. Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once. " What have we got today?" Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge. " Double Potions with the Slytherins," said Ron. " Snape''s Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them -- we''ll be able to see if it''s true." " Wish McGonagall favored us, " said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn''t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before. Just then, the mail arrived.

She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry''s plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl: Dear Harry, I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three? I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig. Hagrid Harry borrowed Ron''s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again. It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far. At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he''d been wrong. Snape didn''t dislike Harry -- he hated him. Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls. Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry''s name. " Ah, Yes," he said softly, "Harry Potter. Our new -- celebrity." Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid''s, but they had none of Hagrid''s warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels. " You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking," he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had y caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. " As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don''t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses.... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death -- if you aren''t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach." More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn''t a dunderhead. " Potter!" said Snape suddenly. " What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?" Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione''s hand had shot into the air. " I don''t know, sit," said Harry. Snape''s lips curled into a sneer. " Tut, tut -- fame clearly isn''t everything." He ignored Hermione''s hand. " Let''s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?" Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn''t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter. " I don''t know, sit." " Thought you wouldn''t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?" Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys'', but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi? Snape was still ignoring Hermione''s quivering hand. " What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?" At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling. " I don''t know," said Harry quietly. " I think Hermione does, though, why don''t you try her?" A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus''s eye', NULL);
INSERT INTO SYSTEM_LOB_STREAM VALUES(4, 48, ', and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased. " Sit down," he snapped at Hermione. " For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren''t you all copying that down?" There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, "And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter." Things didn''t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus''s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people''s shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs. " Idiot boy!" snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. " I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?" Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose. " Take him up to the hospital wing," Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville. " You -- Potter -- why didn''t you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he''d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That''s another point you''ve lost for Gryffindor." This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron. " Doi* push it," he muttered, "I''ve heard Snape can turn very nasty." As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry''s mind was racing and his spirits were low. He''d lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week -- why did Snape hate him so much? " Cheer up," said Ron, "Snape''s always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?" At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door. When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid''s voice rang out, saying, "Back, Fang -- back." Hagrid''s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open. " Hang on," he said. " Back, Fang." He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound. There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it. " Make yerselves at home," said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked. " This is Ron," Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate. " Another Weasley, eh?" said Hagrid, glancing at Ron''s freckles. I spent half me life chasin'' yer twin brothers away from the forest." The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first -lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry''s knee and drooled all over his robes. Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Fitch "that old git."

Can''t get rid of her -- Fitch puts her up to it.\" Harry told Hagrid about Snape''s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students. \" But he seemed to really hate me.\" \" Rubbish!\" said Hagrid. \" Why should he?\" Yet Harry couldn''t help thinking that Hagrid didn''t quite meet his eyes when he said that. \" How''s yer brother Charlie?\" Hagrid asked Ron. \" I liked him a lot -- great with animals.\" Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie''s work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet: GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown. Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day. \" But we''re not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what''s good for you,\" said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon. Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn''t mentioned the date. \" Hagrid!\" said Harry, \"that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday! It might''ve been happening while we were there!\" There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn''t meet Harry''s eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for? As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they''d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he''d had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now?

Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn''t have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn''t until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday -- and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together. \" Typical,\" said Harry darkly. \" Just what I always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.\" He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else. \" You don''t know that you''ll make a fool of yourself,\" said Ron reasonably. \" Anyway, I know Malfoy''s always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that''s all talk.\" Malfay certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn''t the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he''d spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who''d listen about the time he''d almost hit a hang glider on Charlie''s old broom. Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn''t see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean''s poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move. Neville had never been o'), NULL);

Privately, Harry felt she''d had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground. Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. This was something you couldn''t learn by heart out of a book -- not that she hadn''t tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she''d gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione''s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail. Harry hadn''t had a single letter since Hagrid''s note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy''s eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table. A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke. " It''s a Remembrall!" he explained. " Gran knows I forget things -- this tells you if there''s something you''ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red -- oh..." His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, "You''ve forgotten something..." Neville was trying to remember what he''d forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand. Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfay, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash. " What''s going on?" " Malfoy''s got my Remembrall, Professor." Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table. " Just looking," he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him. At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance. The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left. Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk. " Well, what are you all waiting for?" she barked. " Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up." Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles. " Stick out your right hand over your broom," called Madam Hooch at the front, "and say ''Up!"'' " UPF everyone shouted. Harry''s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger''s had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville''s hadn''t moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville''s voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground. Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he''d been doing it wrong for years. " Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard," said Madam Hooch. " Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle -- three -- two --" But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch''s lips.

Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and -- WHAM -- a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight. Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his. " Broken wrist," Harry heard her mutter. " Come on, boy -- it''s all right, up you get.". She turned to the rest of the class. " None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you''ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say ''Quidditch.'' Come on, dear." Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him. No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter. " Did you see his face, the great lump?" The other Slytherins joined in. " Shut up, Malfoy," snapped Parvati Patil. " Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?" said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. " Never thought you''d like fat little crybabies, Parvati." " Look!" said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. " It''s that stupid thing Longbottom''s gran sent him." The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up. " Give that here, Malfoy," said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to watch. Malfoy smiled nastily. " I think I''ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find -- how about -- up a tree?" " Give it here!" Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off. He hadn''t been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, "Come and get it, Potter!" Harry grabbed his broom. " No!" shouted Hermione Granger. " Madam Hooch told us not to move -- you''ll get us all into trouble." Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him -and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he''d found something he could do without being taught -- this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron. He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked stunned. " Give it here," Harry called, "or I''ll knock you off that broom!" " Oh, yeah?" said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried. Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfay like a javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping. " No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy," Harry called. The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy. " Catch it if you can, then!" he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground. Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down -- next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball -- wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching -- he stretched out his hand -- a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist. " HARRY POTTER!" His heart sank faster than he''d just dived. Professor McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling. " Never -- in all my time at Hogwarts --" Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, "-- how dare you -- might have broken your neck --" "It wasn''t his fault, Professor --" "Be quiet, Miss Patil "But Malfoy --" "That''s enough, Mr. Weasley.

He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he''d done it. He hadn''t even lasted two weeks. He''d be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep? Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn''t say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid''s assistant. His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid''s bag. Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door and poked her head inside. " Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?" Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him? But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out of Flitwicles class looking confused. " Follow me, you two," said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry. " In here." Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard. " Out, Peeves!" she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys. " Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood -- I''ve found you a Seeker." Wood''s expression changed from puzzlement to delight. " Are you serious, Professor?" " Absolutely," said Professor McGonagall crisply. " The boy''s a natural. I''ve never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?" Harry nodded silently. He didn''t have a clue what was going on, but he didn''t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs. " He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive," Professor McGonagall told Wood. " Didn''t even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn''t have done it." Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once. " Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?" he asked excitedly. " Wood''s captain of the Gryffindor team," Professor McGonagall explained. " He''s just the build for a Seeker, too," said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him. " Light -- speedy -- we''ll have to get him a decent broom, Professor -- a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I''d say." I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can''t bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn''t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks...." Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry. " I want to hear you''re training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you." Then she suddenly smiled. " Your father would have been proud," she said. " He was an excellent Quidditch player himself." " You''re joking." It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he''d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he''d forgotten all about it. " Seeker?" he said. " But first years never -- you must be the youngest house player in about a century, said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon.

" I tell you, we''re going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year," said Fred. " We haven''t won since Charlie left, but this year''s team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us." " Anyway, we''ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he''s found a new secret passageway out of the school." " Bet it''s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you." Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle. " Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?" " You''re a lot braver now that you''re back on the ground and you''ve got your little friends with you," said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl. " I''d take you on anytime on my own," said Malfoy. " Tonight, if you want. Wizard''s duel. Wands only -- no contact. What''s the matter? Never heard of a wizard''s duel before, I suppose?" " Of course he has," said Ron, wheeling around. " I''m his second, who''s yours?" Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up. " Crabbe," he said. " Midnight all right? We''ll meet you in the trophy room; that''s always unlocked." When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other. " What is a wizard''s duel?" said Harry. " And what do you mean, you''re my second?" " Well, a second''s there to take over if you die," said Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry''s face, he added quickly, "But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy''ll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway." " And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?" " Throw it away and punch him on the nose," Ron suggested. " Excuse me." They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger. " Can''t a person eat in peace in this place?" said Ron. Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry. " I couldn''t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying --" "Bet you could," Ron muttered. " --and you mustn''t go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you''ll lose Gryffindor if you''re caught, and you''re bound to be. It''s really very selfish of you." " And it''s really none of your business," said Harry. " Good-bye," said Ron. All the same, it wasn''t what you''d call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn''t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as "If he tries to curse you, you''d better dodge it, because I can''t remember how to block them." There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoys sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness - this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face. He couldn''t miss it. " Half-past eleven," Ron muttered at last, "we''d better go." They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, "I can''t believe you''re going to do this, Harry." A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown. " You!" said Ron furiously. " Go back to bed!"

She followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose. " Don''t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I don''t want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you''ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells." " Go away." " All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you''re on the train home tomorrow, you''re so --" But what they were, they didn''t find out. Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor tower. " Now what am I going to do?" she asked shrilly. " That''s your problem," said Ron. " We''ve got to go, we 3 re going to be late." They hadn''t even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them. " I''m coming with you," she said. " You are not." " D''you think I''m going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I''ll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up." " You''ve got some nerve --" said Ron loudly. " Shut up, both of you!" said Harry sharply. I heard something." It was a sort of snuffling. " Mrs. Norris?" breathed Ron, squinting through the dark. It wasn''t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer. " Thank goodness you found me! I''ve been out here for hours, I couldn''t remember the new password to get in to bed." " Keep your voice down, Neville. The password''s ''Pig snout'' but it won''t help you now, the Fat Lady''s gone off somewhere." " How''s your arm?" said Harry. " Fine," said Neville, showing them. " Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute." " Good - well, look, Neville, we''ve got to be somewhere, we''ll see you later --" "Don''t leave me!" said Neville, scrambling to his feet, "I don''t want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron''s been past twice already." Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville. " If either of you get us caught, I''ll never rest until I''ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you. Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward. They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room. Malfoy and Crabbe weren''t there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by. " He''s late, maybe he''s chickened out," Ron whispered. Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak -and it wasn''t Malfoy. " Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner." It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch''s voice. Neville''s robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room. " They''re in here somewhere," they heard him mutter, "probably hiding." " This way!" Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run -he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor.

Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following -- they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going -- they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room. " I think we''ve lost him," Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering. I -- told -you," Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, "I -- told -- you." " We''ve got to get back to Gryffindor tower," said Ron, "quickly as possible." " Malfoy tricked you," Hermione said to Harry. " You realize that, don''t you? He was never going to meet you -- Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off." Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn''t going to tell her that. " Let''s go." It wasn''t going to be that simple. They hadn''t gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them. It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight. " Shut up, Peeves -- please -- you''ll get us thrown out." Peeves cackled. " Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you''ll get caughty." " Not if you don''t give us away, Peeves, please." " Should tell Filch, I should," said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. " It''s for your own good, you know." " Get out of the way," snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a big mistake. " STUDENTS OUT OF BED!" Peeves bellowed, "STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR" Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door -- and it was locked. " This is it!" Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, "We''re done for! This is the end!" They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves''s shouts. " Oh, move over," Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry''s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, ''Alohomora!" The lock clicked and the door swung open -- they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening. " Which way did they go, Peeves?" Filch was saying. " Quick, tell me." " Say ''please."'' " Don''t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?" " Shan''t say nothing if you don''t say please," said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice. " All right -please." " NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn''t say nothing if you didn''t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!" And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage. " He thinks this door is locked," Harry whispered. " I think we''ll be okay -- get off, Neville!" For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry''s bathrobe for the last minute. " What?" Harry turned around -- and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was sure he''d walked into a nightmare -- this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far. They weren''t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden. They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs. It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren''t already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant. Harry groped for the doorknob -- between Filch and death, he''d take Filch. They fell backward -- Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran,', NULL);

Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn''t see him anywhere, but they hardly cared -- all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn''t stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor. \" Where on earth have you all been?\" she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces. \" Never mind that -- pig snout, pig snout,\" panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs. It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he''d never speak again. \" What do they think they''re doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?\" said Ron finally. \" If any dog needs exercise, that one does.\" Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. \" You don''t use your eyes, any of you, do you?\" she snapped. \" Didn''t you see what it was standing on. \" The floor?\" Harry suggested. \" I wasn''t looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.\" \" No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It''s obviously guarding something.\" She stood up, glaring at them. I hope you''re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed -- or worse, expelled. Now, if you don''t mind, I''m going to bed.\" Ron stared after her, his mouth open. \" No, we don''t mind,\" he said. \" You''d think we dragged her along, wouldn''t you. But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something.... What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide -- except perhaps Hogwarts. It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby littie package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.</Body>\n        </Block>\n    </Chapter>\n    <Chapter id=\"10\" title=\"CHAPTER TEN HALLOWEEN.\">\n        <Block>\n            <Body>Malfoy couldn''t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection. \" It''s either really valuable or really dangerous,\" said Ron. \" Or both,\" said Harry. But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn''t have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues. Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again. Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later. As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone''s attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel. Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said: DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE. It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don''t want everybody knowing you''ve got a broomstick or they''ll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o''clock for your first training session. Professor McGonagall Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the '), NULL);

They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it. " That''s a broomstick," he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. " You''ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren''t allowed them." Ron couldn''t resist it. " It''s not any old broomstick," he said, "it''s a Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you say you''ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?" Ron grinned at Harry. " Comets look flashy, but they''re not in the same league as the Nimbus." " What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn''t afford half the handle," Malfoy snapped back. " I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig." Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy''s elbow. " Not arguing, I hope, boys?" he squeaked. " Potter''s been sent a broomstick, Professor," said Malfoy quickly. " Yes, yes, that''s right," said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry. " Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter. And what model is it?" " A Nimbus Two Thousand, sit," said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy''s face. " And it''s really thanks to Malfoy here that I''ve got it," he added. Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy''s obvious rage and confusion. " Well, it''s true," Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, "If he hadn''t stolen Neville''s Remembrall I wouln''t be on the team...." "So I suppose you think that''s a reward for breaking rules?" came an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry''s hand. " I thought you weren''t speaking to us?" said Harry. " Yes, don''t stop now," said Ron, "it''s doing us so much good." Hermione marched away with her nose in the air. Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he''d be learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last. " Wow," Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry''s bedspread. Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top. As seven o''clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high. Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling -- he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch. " Hey, Potter, come down!'' Oliver Wood had arrived. fie was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to him. " Very nice," said Wood, his eyes glinting. " I see what McGonagall meant... you really are a natural. I''m just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you''ll be joining team practice three times a week." He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls. " Right," said Wood. " Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it''s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of them are called Chasers." " Three Ch', NULL);
INSERT INTO SYSTEM_LOB_STREAM VALUES(4, 58, 'asers," Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball. " This ball''s called the Quaffle," said Wood. " The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?" " The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score," Harry recited. " So -- that''s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn''t it?" " What''s basketball?" said Wood curiously. " Never mind," said Harry quickly. " Now, there''s another player on each side who''s called the Keeper -I''m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring." " Three Chasers, one Keeper," said Harry, who was determined to remember it all. " And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?" He pointed at the three balls left inside the box. " I''ll show you now," said Wood. " Take this." He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat. " I''m going to show you what the Bludgers do," Wood said. " These two are the Bludgers." He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box. " Stand back," Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers. At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry''s face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air -- it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground. " See?" Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely. " The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms. That''s why you have two Beaters on each team -- the Weasley twins are ours -- it''s their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So -- think you''ve got all that?" " Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team," Harry reeled off. " Very good," said Wood. " Er -- have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?" Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand. " Never at Hogwarts. We''ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. That''s you. And you don''t have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers unless they crack my head open." " Don''t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers -- I mean, they''re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves." Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings. " This," said Wood, "is the Golden Snitch, and it''s the most important ball of the lot. It''s very hard to catch because it''s so fast and difficult to see. It''s the Seeker''s job to catch it. You''ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team''s Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. That''s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages -- I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep. " Well, that''s it -- any questions?" Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem. " We won''t practice with the Snitch yet," said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, "it''s too dark, we might lose it. Let''s try you out with a few of these." He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as h', NULL);

After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn''t carry on. " That Quidditch cup''ll have our name on it this year," said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. " I wouldn''t be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn''t gone off chasing dragons." Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he''d already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics. On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they''d seen him make Neville''s toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry''s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn''t spoken to either of them since the day Harry''s broomstick had arrived. " Now, don''t forget that nice wrist movement we''ve been practicing!" squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual. " Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is very important, too -- never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said ''s'' instead of ''f'' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest." It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it -- Harry had to put it out with his hat. Ron, at the next table, wasn''t having much more luck. " Wingardium Leviosa!" he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill. " You''re saying it wrong," Harry heard Hermione snap. " It''s Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the ''gar'' nice and long." " You do it, then, if you''re so clever," Ron snarled. Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, "Wingardium Leviosa!" Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads. " Oh, well done!" cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. " Everyone see here, Miss Granger''s done it!" Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class. " It''s no wonder no one can stand her," he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, "she''s a nightmare, honestly. " Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face -- and was startled to see that she was in tears. " I think she heard you." " So?" said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. " She must''ve noticed she''s got no friends." Hermione didn''t turn up for the next class and wasn''t seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls'' bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds. A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet. Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face.

It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore''s wand to bring silence. " Prefects," he rumbled, "lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!" Percy was in his element. " Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming through! Excuse me, I''m a prefect!" " How could a troll get in?" Harry asked as they climbed the stairs. " Don''t ask me, they''re supposed to be really stupid," said Ron. " Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke." They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron''s arm. " I''ve just thought -- Hermione." " What about her?" " She doesn''t know about the troll." Ron bit his lip. " Oh, all right," he snapped. " But Percy''d better not see us." Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls'' bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them. " Percy!" hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin. Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view. " What''s he doing?" Harry whispered. " Why isn''t he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?" " Search me." Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape''s fading footsteps. " He''s heading for the third floor," Harry said, but Ron held up his hand. " Can you smell something?" Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean. And then they heard it -- a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed -- at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight. It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long. The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room. " The keys in the lock," Harry muttered. " We could lock it in." " Good idea," said Ron nervously. They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn''t about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it. '' Yes!" Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop -- a high, petrified scream -- and it was coming from the chamber they''d just chained up. " Oh, no," said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron. " It''s the girls'' bathroom!" Harry gasped. " Hermione!" they said together. It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside. Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went. " Confuse it!" Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall. The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went. " Oy, pea-brain!" yelled Ron from the other side of th', NULL);

The troll didn''t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it. " Come on, run, run!" Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn''t move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror. The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape. Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll''s neck from behind. The troll couldn''t feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry''s wand had still been in his hand when he''d jumped -- it had gone straight up one of the troll''s nostrils. Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club. Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand -- not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: "Wingardium Leviosa!" The club flew suddenly out of the troll''s hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over -- and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner''s head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble. Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done. It was Hermione who spoke first. " Is it -- dead?" I don''t think so," said Harry, I think it''s just been knocked out." He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll''s nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue. " Urgh -- troll boogers." He wiped it on the troll''s trousers. A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up. They hadn''t realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll''s roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart. Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry''s mind. " What on earth were you thinking of?" said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air. " You''re lucky you weren''t killed. Why aren''t you in your dormitory?" Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down. Then a small voice came out of the shadows. " Please, Professor McGonagall -- they were looking for me." " Miss Granger!" Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last. I went looking for the troll because I -- I thought I could deal with it on my own -- you know, because I''ve read all about them." Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher? " If they hadn''t found me, I''d be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn''t have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived." Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn''t new to them. " Well -- in that case..." said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of them, "Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?" Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble.

Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron. \" Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.\" They hurried out of the chamber and didn''t speak at all until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else. \" We should have gotten more than ten points,\" Ron grumbled. \" Five, you mean, once she''s taken off Hermione''s.\" \" Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,\" Ron admitted. \" Mind you, we did save her.\" \" She might not have needed saving if we hadn''t locked the thing in with her,\" Harry reminded him. They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady. \" Pig snout,\" they said and entered. The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said \"Thanks,\" and hurried off to get plates.

The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots. The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house championship. Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn''t know which was worse -- people telling him he''d be brilliant or people telling him they''d be running around underneath him holding a mattress. It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermlone as a friend. He didn''t know how he''d have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also tent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read. Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert. Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it. The day before Harry''s first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn''t be allowed. Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces caught Snape''s eye.

Harry showed him. " Library books are not to be taken outside the school," said Snape. " Give it to me. Five points from Gryffindor." " He''s just made that rule up," Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away. " Wonder what''s wrong with his leg?" " Dunno, but I hope it''s really hurting him," said Ron bitterly. The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and Ron''s Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy ("How will you learn?") , but by asking her to read it through, they got the right answers anyway. Harry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it. " Better you than me," they said together, but Harry had an idea that Snape wouldn''t refuse if there were other teachers listening. He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no answer. He knocked again. Nothing. Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He pushed the door ajar and peered inside -- and a horrible scene met his eyes. Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape bandages. " Blasted thing*," Snape was saying. " How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?" Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but -- "POTTER!" Snape''s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg. Harry gulped. " I just wondered if I could have my book back." " GET OUT! OUT!" Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor. He sprinted back upstairs. " Did you get it?" Ron asked as Harry joined them. " What''s the matter?" In a low whisper, Harry told them what he''d seen. " You know what this means?" he finished breathlessly. " He tried to get past that three-headed dog at Halloween! That''s where he was going when we saw him -- he''s after whatever it''s guarding! And Id bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!" Hermione''s eyes were wide. " No -- he wouldn''t, she said. " I know he''s not very nice, but he wouldn''t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe." " Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something," snapped Ron. " I''m with Harry. I wouldn''t put anything past Snape. But what''s he after? What''s that dog guarding?" Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question. Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn''t sleep. He tried to empty his mind -- he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours -- but the expression on Snape''s face when Harry had seen his leg wasn''t easy to forget. The next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer ful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match. " You''ve got to eat some breakfast." " I don''t want anything." " Just a bit of toast," wheedled Hermione. " I''m not hungry." Harry felt terrible. In an hour''s time he''d be walking onto the field. " Harry, you need your strength," said Seamus Finnigan. " Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team." " Thanks, Seamus," said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his sausages. By eleven o''clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes. Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion under', NULL);

Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green). Wood cleared his throat for silence. " Okay, men," he said. " And women," said Chaser Angelina Johnson. " And women," Wood agreed. " This is it." " The big one," said Fred Weasley. " The one we''ve all been waiting for," said George. " We know Oliver''s speech by heart," Fred told Harry, "we were on the team last year." " Shut up, you two," said Wood. " This is the best team Gryffindor''s had in years. We''re going to win. I know it." He glared at them all as if to say, "Or else." " Right. It''s time. Good luck, all of you." Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his knees weren''t going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers. Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand. " Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you," she said, once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year. Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver. " Mount your brooms, please." Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand. Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle. Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off. " And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor -- what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too --" "JORDAN!" " Sorry, Professor." The Weasley twins'' friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall. " And she''s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood''s, last year only a reserve -- back to Johnson and -- no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes -- Flint flying like an eagle up there -- he''s going to sc- no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle -- that''s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and -- OUCH -- that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger -- Quaffle taken by the Slytherins -- that''s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he''s blocked by a second Bludger -- sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can''t tell which -- nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes -- she''s really flying -- dodges a speeding Bludger -- the goal posts are ahead -- come on, now, Angelina -- Keeper Bletchley dives -- misses -- GRYFFINDORS SCORE!" Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins. " Budge up there, move along." " Hagrid!" Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join them. " Bin watchin'' from me hut," said Hagrid, patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck, "But it isn''t the same as bein'' in the crowd. No sign of the Snitch yet, eh?" " Nope," said Ron. " Harry hasn''t had much to do yet." " Kept outta trouble, though, that''s somethin''," said Hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry. Way up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood''s game plan. " Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch," Wood had said. " We don''t want you attacked before you have to be." When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-loops to let off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch. Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys'' wristwatc', NULL);

" All right there, Harry?" he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint. " Slytherin in possession," Lee Jordan was saying, "Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the -- wait a moment -- was that the Snitch?" A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear. Harry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch -all the Chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch. Harry was faster than Higgs -- he could see the little round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead - - he put on an extra spurt of speed -- WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below -- Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry''s broom spun off course, Harry holding on for dear life. " Foul!" screamed the Gryffindors. Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again. Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, "Send him off, ref! Red card!" " What are you talking about, Dean?" said Ron. " Red card!" said Dean furiously. " In soccer you get shown the red card and you''re out of the game!" " But this isn''t soccer, Dean," Ron reminded him. Hagrid, however, was on Dean''s side. " They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air." Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides. " So -- after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating "Jordan!" growled Professor McGonagall. " I mean, after that open and revolting foul ''Jordan, I''m warning you --" "All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I''m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinner, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession." It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees. He''d never felt anything like that. It happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal- posts -- he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out -- and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control. He couldn''t turn it. He couldn''t direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him. Lee was still commentating. " Slytherin in possession -- Flint with the Quaffle -- passes Spinnet -- passes Bell -- hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose -- only joking, Professor -- Slytherins score -- A no... The Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed that Harry''s broom was behaving strangely. It was carrying- him slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went. " Dunno what Harry thinks he''s doing," Hagrid mumbled. He stared through his binoculars. " If I didn'' know better, I''d say he''d lost control of his broom... but he can''t have...." Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry''s broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand. " Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?" Seamus whispered. " Can''t have," Hagrid said, his voice shaking. " Can''t ', NULL);

At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid''s binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd. " What are you doing?" moaned Ron, gray-faced. " I knew it," Hermione gasped, "Snape -- look." Ron grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath. " He''s doing something -- jinxing the broom," said Hermione. " What should we do?" " Leave it to me." Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared. Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good -- every time they got near him, the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing. " Come on, Hermione," Ron muttered desperately. Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; she didn''t even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front. Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few, well- chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape''s robes. It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire. A sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row -- Snape would never know what had happened. It was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom. " Neville, you can look!" Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into Hagrid''s jacket for the last five minutes. Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick -- he hit the field on all fours -- coughed -- and something gold fell into his hand. " I''ve got the Snitch!" he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game ended in complete confusion. " He didn''t catch it, he nearly swallowed it," Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference -- Harry hadn''t broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results -- Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid''s hut, with Ron and Hermione. " It was Snape," Ron was explaining, "Hermione and I saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn''t take his eyes off you." " Rubbish," said Hagrid, who hadn''t heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands. " Why would Snape do somethin'' like that?" Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him. Harry decided on the truth. " I found out something about him," he told Hagrid. " He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever it''s guarding." Hagrid dropped the teapot. " How do you know about Fluffy?" he said. " Fluffy?" " Yeah -- he''s mine -- bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las'' year -- I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the "Yes?" said Harry eagerly. " Now, don''t ask me anymore," said Hagrid gruffly. " That''s top secret, that is." " But Snape''s trying to steal it." " Rubbish," said Hagrid again. " Snape''s a Hogwarts teacher, he''d do nothin'' of the sort." " So why did he just try and kill Harry?" cried Hermione. The afternoon''s events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape. I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I''ve read all about them! You''ve got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn''t blinking at all, I saw him!" " I''m tellin'' yeh, yer wrong!" said Hagrid hotly.

One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again. No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape''s classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons. \" I do feel so sorry,\" said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, \"for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they''re not wanted at home.\" He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he''d realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family. It was true that Harry wasn''t going back to Privet Drive for Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once. He didn''t feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas he''d ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie. When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it. \" Hi, Hagrid, want any help?\" Ron asked, sticking his head through the branches. \" Nah, I''m all right, thanks, Ron.\" \" Would you mind moving out of the way?\" came Malfoys cold drawl from behind them. \" Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose -- that hut of Hagrid''s must seem like a palace compared to what your family''s used to.\" Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs. \" WEASLEY!\" Ron let go of the front of Malfoy''s robes. \" He was provoked, Professor Snape,\" said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree. \" Malfoy was insultin'' his family.\" \" Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,\" said Snape silkily. \" Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn''t more.

The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles. " How many days you got left until yer holidays?" Hagrid asked. " Just one," said Hermione. " And that reminds me -Harry, Ron, we''ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library." " Oh yeah, you''re right," said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree. " The library?" said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. " Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren''t yeh?" " Oh, we''re not working," Harry told him brightly. " Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we''ve been trying to find out who he is." " You what?" Hagrid looked shocked. " Listen here -- I''ve told yeh -- drop it. It''s nothin'' to you what that dog''s guardin''." " We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that''s all," said Hermione. " Unless you''d like to tell us and save us the trouble?" Harry added. " We must''ve been through hundreds of books already and we can''t find him anywhere -- just give us a hint -- I know I''ve read his name somewhere." " I''m sayin'' nothin, said Hagrid flatly. " Just have to find out for ourselves, then," said Ron, and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library. They had indeed been searching books for Flamel''s name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. He wasn''t in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows. Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn''t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he''d never get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts. " What are you looking for, boy?" " Nothing," said Harry. Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him. " You''d better get out, then. Go on -- out!" Wishing he''d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they''d better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she''d be able to tell them, but they couldn''t risk Snape hearing what they were up to. Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn''t very hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks, after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn''t surprising they''d found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks. Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads. They went off to lunch. " You will keep looking while I''m away, won''t you?" said Hermione. " And send me an owl if you find anything." " And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is," said Ron. " It''d be safe to ask them." " Very safe, as they''re both dentists," said Hermione. Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel.

They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork -- bread, English muffins, marshmallows -- and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn''t work. Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle. Ron''s set was very old and battered. Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family -- in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren''t a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted. Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn''t trust him at all. He wasn''t a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. " Don''t send me there, can''t you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose him." On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all. When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed. " Merry Christmas," said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe. " You, too," said Harry. " Will you look at this? I''ve got some presents!" " What did you expect, turnips?" said Ron, turning to his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry''s. Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it -- it sounded a bit like an owl. A second, very small parcel contained a note. We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece. " That''s friendly," said Harry. Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence. " Weird!" he said, ''NMat a shape! This is money?" " You can keep it," said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. " Hagrid and my aunt and uncle -- so who sent these?" " I think I know who that one''s from," said Ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel. " My mom. I told her you didn''t expect any presents and -- oh, no," he groaned, "she''s made you a Weasley sweater." Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge. " Every year she makes us a sweater," said Ron, unwrapping his own, "and mine''s always maroon." " That''s really nice of her," said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty. His next present also contained candy -- a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione. This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very light. He unwrapped it. Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped. " I''ve heard of those," he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he''d gotten from Hermione. " If that''s what I think it is -- they''re really rare, and really valuable." " What is it?" Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material. " It''s an invisibility cloak," said Ron, a look of awe on his face. " I''m sure it is -- try it on." Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell. " It is! Look down!" Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely. " There''s a note!" said Ron suddenly. " A note fell out of it!" Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter.

Who had sent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father? Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight. He didn''t feel like sharing it with anyone else yet. " Merry Christmas!" " Hey, look -- Harry''s got a Weasley sweater, too!" Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G. "Harry''s is better than ours, though," said Fred, holding up Harry''s sweater. " She obviously makes more of an effort if you''re not family." " Why aren''t you wearing yours, Ron?" George demanded. " Come on, get it on, they''re lovely and warm." " I hate maroon," Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head. " You haven''t got a letter on yours," George observed. " I suppose she thinks you don''t forget your name. But we''re not stupid -- we know we''re called Gred and Forge." " What''s all th is noise. Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized. " P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we''re all wearing ours, even Harry got one." " I -- don''t -- want said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew. " And you''re not sitting with the prefects today, either," said George. " Christmas is a time for family." They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater. Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce -- and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn''t just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral''s hat and several live, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard''s hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him. Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry''s amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided. When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set. The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. Norris''s Christmas dinner. Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn''t have lost so badly if Percy hadn''t tried to help him so much. After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because they''d stolen his prefect badge.

Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he''d drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it. His father''s... this had been his father''s. He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note had said. He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a very funny feeling. Use it well. Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know. Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him back -- his father''s cloak -- he felt that this time -- the first time -- he wanted to use it alone. He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole. " Who''s there?" squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked quickly down the corridor. Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He''d be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was. He set off, drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked. The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps. The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Step ping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles. They didn''t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn''t understand. Some had no title at all. One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back of Harry''s neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn''t be. He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book. A large black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open. A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence -- the book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside -- stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch''s pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch''s outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book''s shrieks still ringing in his ears. He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn''t paid attention to where he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn''t recognize where he was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there. " You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody''s been in the library Restricted Section." Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, "The Restricted Section? Well, they can''t be far, we''ll catch them." Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ', NULL);

They couldn''t see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they''d knock right into him -- the cloak didn''t stop him from being solid. He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in. It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket -- but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn''t look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way. It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it. He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed -- for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him. But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror. There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder -- but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror''s trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not? He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he''d touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air -- she and the others existed only in the mirror. She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes -- her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright green -- exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry''s did. Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection. " Mom?" he whispered. " Dad?" They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry''s knobbly knees -- Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life. The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness. How long he stood there, he didn''t know. The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. He couldn''t stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother''s face, whispered, "I''ll come back," and hurried from the room. " You could have woken me up," said Ron, crossly. " You can come tonight, I''m going back, I want to show you the mirror. " I''d like to see your mom and dad," Ron said eagerly. " And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you''ll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone', NULL);

Shame about not finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren''t you eating anything?" Harry couldn''t eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn''t seem very important anymore. Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really? " Are you all right?" said Ron. " You look odd." What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry''s route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour. " I''m freezing," said Ron. " Let''s forget it and go back." " No!" Harry hissed. I know it''s here somewhere." They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else. just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor. " It''s here -- just here -- yes!" They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror. There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him. " See?" Harry whispered. " I can''t see anything." " Look! Look at them all... there are loads of them...." "I can only see you." " Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am." Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn''t see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas. Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image. " Look at me!" he said. " Can you see all your family standing around you?" " No -- I''m alone -- but I''m different -- I look older -- and I''m head boy!" " What?" " I am -- I''m wearing the badge like Bill used to -- and I''m holding the house cup and the Quidditch cup -- I''m Quidditch captain, too. Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry. " Do you think this mirror shows the future?" " How can it? All my family are dead -- let me have another look --" "You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time." " You''re only holding the Quidditch cup, what''s interesting about that? I want to see my parents." " Don''t push me --" A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion. They hadn''t realized how loudly they had been talking. " Quick!" Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing -- did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she turned and left. " This isn''t safe -- she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us. Come on." And Ron pulled Harry out of the room. The snow still hadn''t melted the next morning. " Want to play chess, Harry?" said Ron. " No." " Why don''t we go down and visit Hagrid?" " No... you go..." "I know what you''re thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don''t go back tonight." " Why not?" " I dunno, I''ve just got a bad feeling about it -- and anyway, you''ve had too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. So what if they can''t see you? What if they walk into you? What if you knock something over?" " You sound like Hermione." " I''m serious, Harry, don''t go." But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn''t going to stop him. That third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn''t meet anyone. And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family. Nothing at all. Except -- "So -- back again, Harry?" Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice.

Harry wished he could forget what he''d seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn''t. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter. \" You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,\" said Ron, when Harry told him about these drearns. Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (\"If Filch had caught you!\") , and disappointment that he hadn''t at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was. They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a li- brary book, even though Harry was still sure he''d read the name somewhere. Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again. Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn''t dampen his spirits.

Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training. Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He''d just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms. " Will you stop messing around!" he yelled. " That''s exactly the sort of thing that''ll lose us the match! Snape''s refereeing this time, and he''ll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!" George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words. " Snape''s refereeing?" he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. " When''s he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He''s not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin." The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too. " It''s not my fault," said Wood. " We''ve just got to make sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn''t got an excuse to pick on us." Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch.... The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her. " Don''t talk to me for a moment," said Ron when Harry sat down next to him, "I need to concen --" He caught sight of Harry''s face. " What''s the matter with you? You look terrible." Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape''s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee. " Don''t play," said Hermione at once. " Say you''re ill," said Ron. " Pretend to break your leg," Hermione suggested. " Really break your leg," said Ron. " I can''t," said Harry. " There isn''t a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor can''t play at all." At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone''s guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower. Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville''s legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling. " What happened?" Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with Harry and Ron. " Malfoy," said Neville shakily. " I met him outside the library. He said he''d been looking for someone to practice that on." " Go to Professor McGonagall!" Hermione urged Neville. " Report him!" Neville shook his head. " I don''t want more trouble," he mumbled. " You''ve got to stand up to him, Neville!" said Ron. " He''s used to walking all over people, but that''s no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier." " There''s no need to tell me I''m not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy''s already done that," Neville choked out. Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas. He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry. " You''re worth twelve of Malfoy," Harry said. " The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn''t it? And where''s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin." Neville''s lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog. " Thanks, Harry... I think I''ll go to bed.... D''you want the card, you collect them, don''t you?" As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card. " Dumbledore again," he said, "He was the first one I ever-" He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione. " I''ve found him!" he whispered. " I''ve found Flamel!

Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadn''t looked so excited since they''d gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework. " Stay there!" she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls'' dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms. " I never thought to look in here!" she whispered excitedly. " I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading." " Light?" said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she''d looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself. At last she found what she was looking for. " I knew it! I knew it!" " Are we allowed to speak yet?" said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him. " Nicolas Flamel," she whispered dramatically, "is the only known maker of the Sorcerer''s Stone!" This didn''t have quite the effect she''d expected. " The what?" said Harry and Ron. " Oh, honestly, don''t you two read? Look -- read that, there." She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer''s Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal. There have been many reports of the Sorcerer''s Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight). " See?" said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. " The dog must be guarding Flamel''s Sorcerer''s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they''re friends and he knew someone was after it, that''s why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!" " A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!" said Harry. " No wonder Snape''s after it! Anyone would want it." " And no wonder we couldn''t find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry," said Ron. " He''s not exactly recent if he''s six hundred and sixty-five, is he?" The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they''d do with a Sorcerer''s Stone if they had one. It wasn''t until Ron said he''d buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match. " I''m going to play," he told Ron and Hermione. " If I don''t, all the Slytherins will think I''m just too scared to face Snape. I''ll show them... it''ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win." " Just as long as we''re not wiping you off the field," said Hermione. As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn''t too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee? Harry didn''t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they''d found out about the Sorcerer''s Stone? Harry didn''t see how he could -- yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds. Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they''d ever see him alive again. This wasn''t what you''d call comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood''s pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus ', NULL);

Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn''t understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They''d gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry. " Now, don''t forget, it''s Locomotor Mortis," Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve. " I know," Ron snapped. " Don''t nag." Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside. " Don''t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it''s now. Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much." " The whole school''s out there!" said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door. " Even -- blimey -- Dumbledore''s come to watch!" Harry''s heart did a somersault. " Dumbledore?" he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was right. There was no mistaking that silver beard. Harry could have laughed out loud with relief He was safe. There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching. Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too. " I''ve never seen Snape look so mean," he told Hermione. " Look -they''re off Ouch!" Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy. " Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn''t see you there." Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle. " Wonder how long Potter''s going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?" Ron didn''t answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch. " You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?" said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. " It''s people they feel sorry for. See, there''s Potter, who''s got no parents, then there''s the Weasleys, who''ve got no money -- you should be on the team, Longbottom, you''ve got no brains." Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy. " I''m worth twelve of you, Malfoy," he stammered. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, "You tell him, Neville." " Longbottom, if brains were gold you''d be poorer than Weasley, and that''s saying something." Ron''s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry. " I''m warning you, Malfoy -- one more word "Ron!" said Hermione suddenly, "Harry --" "What? Where?" Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet. " You''re in luck, Weasley, Potter''s obviously spotted some money on the ground!" said Malfoy. Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help. " Come on, Harry!" Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape -- she didn''t even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle. Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches -- the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand. The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so quickly. " Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game''s over! Harry''s won! We''ve won!

As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped -- then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore''s smiling face. " Well done," said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear. " Nice to see you haven''t been brooding about that mirror... been keeping busy... excellent..." Snape spat bitterly on the ground. Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldn''t ever remember feeling happier. He''d really done something to be proud of now -- no one could say he was just a famous name any more. The evening air had never smelled so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed. Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun. Gryffindor in the lead. He''d done it, he''d shown Snape.... And speaking of Snape... A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest. Harry''s victory faded from his mind as he watched. He recognized the figure''s prowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner -- what was going on? Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off. Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run. He followed. The trees were so thick he couldn''t see where Snape had gone. He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree. He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves. Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn''t alone. Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldn''t make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they were saying. " ... d-don''t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places, Severus..." "Oh, I thought we''d keep this private," said Snape, his voice icy. " Students aren''t supposed to know about the Sorcerer''s Stone, after all." Harry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape interrupted him. " Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid''s yet?" " B-b-but Severus, I --" "You don''t want me as your enemy, Quirrell," said Snape, taking a step toward him. " I-I don''t know what you "You know perfectly well what I mean." An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, "-- your little bit of hocus-pocus. I''m waiting." " B-but I d-d-don''t --" "Very well," Snape cut in. " We''ll have another little chat soon, when you''ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie." He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified. " Harry, where have you been?" Hermione squeaked. " We won! You won! We won!" shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back. " And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed!

Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which surely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell''s stutter. Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer''s Stone. She had started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her notes. Harry and Ron wouldn''t have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same. \" Hermione, the exams are ages away.\" \" Ten weeks,\" Hermione snapped. \" That''s not ages, that''s like a second to Nicolas Flamel.\" \" But we''re not six hundred years old,\" Ron reminded her. \" Anyway, what are you studying for, you already know it A.\" \"What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year? They''re very important, I should have started studying a month ago, I don''t know what''s gotten into me....\" Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as Hermione. They piled so much homework on them that the Easter holidays weren''t nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon''s blood or practicing wand movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work. \" I''ll never remember this,\" Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was the first really fine day they''d had in months. The sky was a clear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming. Harry, who was looking up \"Dittany\" in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn''t look up until he heard Ron say, \"Hagrid! What are you doing in the library?\" Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back. He looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat. \" Jus'' lookin'',\" he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at once. \" An'' what''re you lot up ter?\" He looked suddenly suspicious. \" Yer not still lookin'' fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?\" \" Oh, we found out who he is ages ago,\" said Ron impressively. \" And we know what that dog''s guarding, it''s a Sorcerer''s St --\" \"Shhhh!\" Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening. \" Don'' go shoutin'' about it, what''s the matter with yeh?\" \" There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,\" said Harry, \"about what''s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy --\" \"SHHHH!\" said Hagrid again. \" Listen - come an'' see me later, I''m not promisin'' I''ll tell yeh anythin'', mind, but don'' go rabbitin'' about it in here, students aren'' s''pposed ter know. They''ll think I''ve told yeh --\" \"See you later, then,\" said Harry. Hagrid shuffled off. \" What was he hiding behind his back?\" said Hermione thoughtfully. \" Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?\" \" I''m going to see what section he was in,\" said Ron, who''d had enough of working. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table. \" Dra'), NULL);

Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper''s Guide." " Hagrid''s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him, " said Harry. " But it''s against our laws," said Ron. " Dragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks'' Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It''s hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we''re keeping dragons in the back garden - anyway, you can''t tame dragons, it''s dangerous. You should see the burns Charlie''s got off wild ones in Romania." " But there aren''t wild dragons in Britain?" said Harry. " Of course there are," said Ron. " Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who''ve spotted them, to make them forget." " So what on earths Hagrid up to?" said Hermione. When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper''s hut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid called "Who is it?" before he let them in, and then shut the door quickly behind them. It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused. " So -- yeh wanted to ask me somethin''?" " Yes," said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. " We were wondering if you could tell us what''s guarding the Sorcerer''s Stone apart from Fluffy." Hagrid frowned at him. " 0'' course I cant, he said. " Number one, I don'' know meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn'' tell yeh if I could. That Stone''s here fer a good reason. It Was almost stolen outta Gringotts - I s''ppose yeh''ve worked that out an'' all? Beats me how yeh even know abou'' Fluffy." " Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here," said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice. Hagrid''s beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling. " We only wondered who had done the guarding, really." Hermione went on. " We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you." Hagrid''s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione. " Well, I don'' s''pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that... let''s see... he borrowed Fluffy from me... then some o'' the teachers did enchantments... Professor Sprout -- Professor Flitwick -- Professor McGonagall --" he ticked them off on his fingers, "Professor Quirrell -- an'' Dumbledore himself did somethin'', o'' course. Hang on, I''ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor Snape." " Snape?" " Yeah -- yer not still on abou'' that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped protect the Stone, he''s not about ter steal it." Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything -- except, it seemed, Quirrell''s spell and how to get past Fluffy. " You''re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy. aren''t you, Hagrid?" said Harry anxiously. " And you wouldn''t tell anyone, would you? Not even one of the teachers?" " Not a soul knows except me an'' Dumbledore," said Hagrid proudly. " Well, that''s something," Harry muttered to the others. " Hagrid, can we have a window open? I''m boiling." " Can''t, Harry, sorry," said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at the fire. Harry looked at it, too. " Hagrid -- what''s that?" But he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg. " Ah," said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, "That''s er..." "Where did you get it, Hagrid?" said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg. " It must''ve cost you a fortune." " Won it," said Hagrid. " Las'' night. I was down in the village havin'' a few drinks an'' got into a game o'' cards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest." " But what are you goin', NULL);

" Got this outta the library -- Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit -- it''s a bit outta date, o'' course, but it''s all in here. Keep the egg in the fire, ''cause their mothers breathe on I em, see, an'' when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o'' brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An'' see here -- how ter recognize diff''rent eggs -- what I got there''s a Norwegian Ridgeback. They''re rare, them." He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn''t. " Hagrid, you live in a wooden house," she said. But Hagrid wasn''t listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the fire. So now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut. " Wonder what it''s like to have a peaceful life," Ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts. Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid. He had written only two words: It''s hatching. Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione wouldn''t hear of it. " Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?" " We''ve got lessons, we''ll get into trouble, and that''s nothing to what Hagrid''s going to be in when someone finds out what he''s doing --" "Shut up!" Harry whispered. Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How much had he heard? Harry didn''t like the look on Malfoy''s face at all. Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid''s with the other two during morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited. " It''s nearly out." He ushered them inside. The egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it. They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath. All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The baby dragon flopped onto the table. It wasn''t exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes. It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout. " Isn''t he beautiful?" Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand to stroke the dragon''s head. It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs. " Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!" said Hagrid. " Hagrid," said Hermione, "how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?" Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face -- he leapt to his feet and ran to the window. " What''s the matter?" " Someone was lookin'' through the gap in the curtains -- it''s a kid -- he''s runnin'' back up ter the school." Harry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance there was no mistaking him. Malfoy had seen the dragon. Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy''s face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They spent most of their free time in Hagrid''s darkened hut, trying to reason with him. " Just let him go," Harry urged. " Set him free." " I can''t," said Hagrid. " He''s too little. He''d die." They looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in just a week. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn''t been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. There were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor. " I''ve decided to call him Norbert," said Hagrid, looking at the dragon with misty eyes. " He really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norber', NULL);

" Hagrid," said Harry loudly, "give it two weeks and Norbert''s going to be as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment." Hagrid bit his lip. " I -- I know I can''t keep him forever, but I can''t jus'' dump him, I can''t." Harry suddenly turned to Ron. Charlie, he said. " You''re losing it, too," said Ron. " I''m Ron, remember?" " No -- Charlie -- your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying dragons. We could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild!" " Brilliant!" said Ron. " How about it, Hagrid?" And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send -an owl to Charlie to ask him. The following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed. The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry''s invisibility cloak. He had been down at Hagrid''s hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate. " It bit me!" he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. " I''m not going to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that dragon''s the most horrible animal I''ve ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you''d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby." There was a tap on the dark window. " It''s Hedwig!" said Harry, hurrying to let her in. " She''ll have Charlie''s answer!" The three of them put their heads together to read the note. Dear Ron, How are you? Thanks for the letter -- I''d be glad to take the Norwegian Ridgeback, but it won''t be easy getting him here. I think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn''t be seen carrying an illegal dragon. Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and take him away while it''s still dark. Send me an answer as soon as possible. Love, Charlie They looked at one another. " We''ve got the invisibility cloak," said Harry. " It shouldn''t be too difficult -- I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and Norbert." It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert -- and Malfoy. There was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron''s bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size. He didn''t know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey -- would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked as if Norbert''s fangs were poisonous. Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed. " It''s not just my hand," he whispered, "although that feels like it''s about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me -- I''ve told her it was a dog, but I don''t think she believes me -I shouldn''t have hit him at the Quidditch match, that''s why he''s doing this." Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down. " It''ll all be over at midnight on Saturday," said Hermione, but this didn''t soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat. " Midnight on Saturday!" he said in a hoarse voice. " Oh no oh no -- I''ve just remembered -- Charlie''s letter was in that book Malfoy took, he''s going to know we''re getting rid of Norbert." Harry and Hermione didn''t get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep. " It''s too late to change the plan now," Harry told Hermione. " We haven''t got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert. We''ll have to risk it. And we have got the invisibility cloak, Malf', NULL);

It''s all right, he only got my boot -- jus'' playin'' -- he''s only a baby, after all.\" The baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle. Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn''t come quickly enough. They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say good-bye to Norbert if they hadn''t been so worried about what they had to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late arriving at Hagrid''s hut because they''d had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall, where he''d been playing tennis against the wall. Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate. \" He''s got lots o'' rats an'' some brandy fer the journey,\" said Hagrid in a muffled voice. \" An'' I''ve packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely.\" From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off. \" Bye-bye, Norbert!\" Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves. \" Mommy will never forget you!\" How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors. UP another staircase, then another -- even one of Harry''s shortcuts didn''t make the work much easier. \" Nearly there!\" Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower. Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate. Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away. A lamp flared. Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear. \" Detention!\" she shouted. \" And twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you --\" \"You don''t understand, Professor. Harry Potter''s coming -- he''s got a dragon!\" \" What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on -- I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!\" The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not until they''d stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig. \" Malfoy''s got detention! I could sing!\" \" Don''t,\" Harry advised her. Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his crate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness. Charlie''s friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they''d rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them. They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much. At last, Norbert was going... going... gone. They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon -- Malfoy in detention -- what could spoil their happiness? The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they stepped into the corridor, Filch''s face loomed suddenly out of the darkness. \" Well, well, well,\" he whispered, \"we are in trouble.\" They''d left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower.</Body>\n        </Block>\n    </Chapter>\n    <Chapter id=\"15\" title=\"CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE FORIBIDDEN FOREST.\">\n        <Block>\n            <Body>Things couldn''t have been worse.

He couldn''t see how they were going to get out of trouble this time. They were cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the invisibility cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already. Had Harry thought that things couldn''t have been worse? He was wrong. When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville. " Harry!" Neville burst Out, the moment he saw the other two. " I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he said you had a drag --" Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over the three of them. " I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you were up in the astronomy tower. It''s one o''clock in the morning. Explain yourselves." It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher''s question. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue. " I think I''ve got a good idea of what''s been going on," said Professor McGonagall. " It doesn''t take a genius to work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed and into trouble. I''ve already caught him. I suppose you think it''s funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it, too?" Harry caught Neville''s eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasn''t true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering Neville -- Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark, to warn them. " I''m disgusted," said Professor McGonagall. " Four students out of bed in one night! I''ve never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of you will receive detentions -- yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it''s very dangerous -- and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor." " Fifty?" Harry gasped -- they would lose the lead, the lead he''d won in the last Quidditch match. " Fifty points each," said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose. " Professor -- please "You can''t --" "Don''t tell me what I can and can''t do, Potter. Now get back to bed, all of you. I''ve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students." A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In one night, they''d ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house cup. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. How could they ever make up for this? Harry didn''t sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn''t think of anything to say to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the dawn. What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they''d done? At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought there''d been a mistake. How could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lo st them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years. From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the house cup.

" They''ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they''ve been here, and people still like them." " They''ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have they?" said Harry miserably. " Well -- no," Ron admitted. It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren''t his business from now on. He''d had it with sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team. " Resign?" Wood thundered. " What good''ll that do? How are we going to get any points back if we can''t win at Quidditch?" But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn''t speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him "the Seeker." Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn''t have as bad a time as Harry, because they weren''t as well-known, but nobody would speak to them, either. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in silence. Harry was almost glad that the exams weren''t far away. All the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions.... Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry''s new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn''t concern him was put to an unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he heard Quirrell''s voice. " No -- no -- not again, please --" It sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry moved closer. " All right -- all right --" he heard Quirrell sob. Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry. He strode out of sight; Harry didn''t think Quirrell had even noticed him. He waited until Quirrell''s footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he''d promised himself about not meddling. All the same, he''d have gambled twelve Sorcerer''s Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step -- Quirrell seemed to have given in at last. Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy. Harry told them what he''d heard. " Snape''s done it, then!" said Ron. " If Quirrell''s told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell --" "There''s still Fluffy, though," said Hermione. " Maybe Snape''s found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid," said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. " I bet there''s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?" The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron''s eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could. " Go to Dumbledore. That''s what we should have done ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we''ll be thrown out for sure." " But we''ve got no proof!" said Harry. " Quirrell''s too scared to back us up. Snape''s only got to say he doesn''t know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor -- who do you think they''ll believe, him or us? It''s not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore''ll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn''t help us if his life depended on it, he''s too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he''ll think. And don''t forget, we''re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That''ll take a lot of explaining." Hermione looked convince', NULL);

He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons. The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table. They were all the same: Your detention will take place at eleven o''clock tonight. Meet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall. Professor McGonagall Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they''d lost. He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn''t say a word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved what they''d got. At eleven o''clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch was already there -- and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too. " Follow me," said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside. I bet you''ll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won''t you, eh?" he said, leering at them. " Oh yes... hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me.... It''s just a pity they let the old punishments die out... hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I''ve got the chains still in my office, keep ''em well oiled in case they''re ever needed.... Right, off we go, and don''t think of running off, now, it''ll be worse for you if you do." They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn''t be sounding so delighted. The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid''s hut. Then they heard a distant shout. " Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started." Harry''s heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it wouldn''t be so bad. His relief must have showed in his -face, because Filch said, "I suppose you think you''ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? Well, think again, boy -- it''s into the forest you''re going and I''m much mistaken if you''ll all come out in one piece." At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his tracks. " The forest?" he repeated, and he didn''t sound quite as cool as usual. " We can''t go in there at night -- there''s all sorts of things in there -- werewolves, I heard." Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry''s robe and made a choking noise. " That''s your problem, isn''t it?" said Filch, his voice cracking with glee. " Should''ve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn''t you?" Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel. He was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder. " Abou'' time," he said. " I bin waitin'' fer half an hour already. All right, Harry, Hermione?" " I shouldn''t be too friendly to them, Hagrid," said Filch coldly, they''re here to be punished, after all."

" I''ll be back at dawn," said Filch, "for what''s left of them," he added nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the darkness. Malfoy now turned to Hagrid. " I''m not going in that forest, he said, and Harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice. " Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts," said Hagrid fiercely. " Yeh''ve done wrong an'' now yehve got ter pay fer it." " But this is servant stuff, it''s not for students to do. I thought we''d be copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he''d tell yer that''s how it is at Hogwarts," Hagrid growled. " Copyin'' lines! What good''s that ter anyone? Yeh''ll do summat useful or Yeh''ll get out. If yeh think yer father''d rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an'' pack. Go on"'' Malfoy didn''t move. He looked at H', NULL);

" Right then," said Hagrid, "now, listen carefully, ''cause it''s dangerous what we''re gonna do tonight, an'' I don'' want no one takin'' risks. Follow me over here a moment." He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest. " Look there," said Hagrid, "see that stuff shinin'' on the ground? Silvery stuff? That''s unicorn blood. There''s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday. We''re gonna try an'' find the poor thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery." " And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?" said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his voice. " There''s nothin'' that lives in the forest that''ll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang," said Hagrid. " An'' keep ter the path. Right, now, we''re gonna split inter two parties an'' follow the trail in diff''rent directions. There''s blood all over the place, it must''ve bin staggerin'' around since last night at least." " I want Fang," said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang''s long teeth. " All right, but I warn yeh, he''s a coward," said Hagrid. " So me, Harry, an'' Hermione''ll go one way an'' Draco, Neville, an'' Fang''ll go the other. Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we''ll send up green sparks, right? Get yer wands out an'' practice now -- that''s it -- an'' if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an'' we''ll all come an'' find yeh -- so, be careful -- let''s go." The forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right. They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on the fallen leaves. Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried. " Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?" Harry asked. " Not fast enough," said Hagrid. " It''s not easy ter catch a unicorn, they''re powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before." They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running water; there must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path. " You all right, Hermione?" Hagrid whispered. " Don'' worry, it can''t''ve gone far if it''s this badly hurt, an'' then we''ll be able ter -- GET BEHIND THAT TREE!" Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away. " I knew it, " he murmured. " There''s summat in here that shouldn'' be." " A werewolf?" Harry suggested. " That wasn'' no werewolf an'' it wasn'' no unicorn, neither," said Hagrid grimly. " Right, follow me, but careful, now." They walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound. Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved. " Who''s there?" Hagrid called. " Show yerself -- I''m armed!" And into the clearing came -- was it a man, or a horse? To the waist, a man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse''s gleaming chestnut body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione''s jaws dropped. " Oh, it''s you, Ronan," said Hagrid in relief. " How are yeh?" He walked forward and shook the centaur''s hand. " Good evening to you, Hagrid," said Ronan. He had a deep, sorrowful voice. " Were you going to shoot me?" " Can''t be too careful, Ronan," said Hagrid, patting his crossbow. " There''s summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an'' Hermione Granger, by the way. Students up at the school. An'' this is Ronan, you two. He''s a centaur.)) " We''d noticed," said Hermione faintly. " Good even', NULL);

Well, that''s something." Ronan sighed. He flung back his head and stared at the sky. " Mars is bright tonight." " Yeah," said Hagrid, glancing up, too. " Listen, I''m glad we''ve run inter yeh, Ronan, ''cause there''s a unicorn bin hurt -- you seen anythin''?" Ronan didn''t answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward, then sighed again. " Always the innocent are the first victims," he said. " So it has been for ages past, so it is now." " Yeah," said Hagrid, "but have yeh seen anythin'', Ronan? Anythin'' unusual?" " Mars is bright tonight," Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him impatiently. " Unusually bright." " Yeah, but I was meanin'' anythin'' unusual a bit nearer home, said Hagrid. " So yeh haven''t noticed anythin'' strange?" Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, "The forest hides many secrets." A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than Ronan. " Hullo, Bane," said Hagrid. " All right?" " Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?" " Well enough. Look, I''ve jus'' bin askin'' Ronan, you seen anythin'' odd in here lately? There''s a unicorn bin injured -- would yeh know anythin'' about it?" Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward. " Mars is bright tonight," he said simply. " We''ve heard," said Hagrid grumpily. " Well, if either of you do see anythin'', let me know, won''t yeh? We''ll be off, then." Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view. " Never," said Hagrid irritably, "try an'' get a straight answer out of a centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin'' closer''n the moon." " Are there many of them in here?" asked Hermione. " Oh, a fair few... Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they''re good enough about turnin'' up if ever I want a word. They''re deep, mind, centaurs... they know things... jus'' don'' let on much." " D''you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?" said Harry. " Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what''s bin killin'' the unicorns -- never heard anythin'' like it before." They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were being watched. He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them. They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid''s arm. " Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!" " You two wait here!" Hagrid shouted. " Stay on the path, I''ll come back for yeh!" They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn''t hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them. " You don''t think they''ve been hurt, do you?" whispered Hermione. " I don''t care if Malfoy has, but if something''s got Neville... it''s our fault he''s here in the first place." The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Harry''s seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was going on? Where were the others? At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid''s return. Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had panicked and sent up the sparks. " We''ll be lucky ter catch anythin'' now, with the racket you two were makin''. Right, we''re changin'' groups -- Neville, you stay with me an'' Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an'' this idiot. I''m sorry," Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry, "but he''ll have a harder time frightenin'' you, an'' we''ve gotta get this done." So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to b', NULL);

Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak. " Look --" he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy. Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer. It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves. Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered.... Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal''s side, and began to drink its blood. " AAAAAAAAAARGH!" Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted -- so did Fang. The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry -- unicorn blood was dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry -- he couldn''t move for fear. Then a pain like he''d never felt before pierced his head; it was as though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure. The pain in Harry''s head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white-blond hair and a palomino body. " Are you all right?" said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet. " Yes -- thank you -- what was that?" The centaur didn''t answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry''s forehead. " You are the Potter boy," he said. " You had better get back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time -- especially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker this way. " My name is Firenze," he added, as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back. There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty. " Firenze!" Bane thundered. " What are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?" " Do you realize who this is?" said Firenze. " This is the Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the better." " What have you been telling him?" growled Bane. " Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?" Ronan pawed the ground nervously. " I''m sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best, " he said in his gloomy voice. Bane kicked his back legs in anger. " For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!" Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on. " Do you not see that unicorn?" Firenze bellowed at Bane. " Do you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must." And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them. Harry didn''t have a clue what was going on. " Why''s Bane so angry?" he asked. " What was that thing you saved me from, anyway?" Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry''s question.

" Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used -for?" " No," said Harry, startled by the odd question. " We''ve only used the horn and tail hair in Potions." " That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn," said Firenze. " Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips." Harry stared at the back of Firenze''s head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight. " But who''d be that desperate?" he wondered aloud. " If you''re going to be cursed forever, deaths better, isn''t it?" " It is," Firenze agreed, "unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else -- something that will bring you back to full strength and power -- something that will mean you can never die. Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?" " The Sorcerer''s Stone! Of course -- the Elixir of Life! But I don''t understand who --" "Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?" It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry''s heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: "Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die." " Do you mean," Harry croaked, "that was Vol-" "Harry! Harry, are you all right?" Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind her. " I''m fine," said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. " The unicorn''s dead, Hagrid, it''s in that clearing back there." " This is where I leave you," Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. " You are safe now." Harry slid off his back. " Good luck, Harry Potter," said Firenze. " The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times." He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him. Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest. Harry couldn''t sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He was still shaking. " Snape wants the stone for Voldemort... and Voldemort''s waiting in the forest... and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich...." "Stop saying the name!" said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them. Harry wasn''t listening. " Firenze saved me, but he shouldn''t have done so.... Bane was furious... he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen.... They must show that Voldemort''s coming back.... Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me.... I suppose that''s written in the stars as well." " Will you stop saying the name!" Ron hissed. " So all I''ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone," Harry went on feverishly, "then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off... Well, I suppose Bane''ll be happy." Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort. " Harry, everyone says Dumbledore''s the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of With Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won''t touch you. Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says that''s a very imprecise branch of magic." The sky had turned light before they stopped talking.

Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door. It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an AntiCheating spell. They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox -- points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion. Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn''t sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it. Maybe it was because they hadn''t seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn''t have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn''t seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn''t keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn''t have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to. Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who''d invented selfstirring cauldrons and they''d be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn''t help cheering with the rest. \" That was far easier than I thought it would be,\" said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. \" I needn''t have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.\" Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. \" No more studying,\" Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. \" You could look more cheerful, Harry, we''ve got a week before we find out how badly we''ve done, there''s no need to worry yet.\" Harry was rubbing his forehead. \" I wish I knew what this means!\" he burst out angrily. \" My scar keeps hurting -- it''s happened before, but never as often as this.\" \" Go to Madam Pomfrey,\" Hermione suggested. \" I''m not ill,\" said Harry. \" I think it''s a warning... it means danger''s coming....\" Ron couldn''t get worked up, it was too hot. \" Harry, relax, Hermione''s right, the Stone''s safe as long as Dumbledore''s around. Anyway, we''ve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he''s not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.\" Harry nodded, but he couldn''t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he''d forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, \"That''s just the exams.

Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy... never... but -- Harry suddenly jumped to his feet. " Where''re you going?" said Ron sleepily. " I''ve just thought of something," said Harry. He had turned white. " We''ve got to go and see Hagrid, now." " Why?" panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up. " Don''t you think it''s a bit odd," said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, "that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it''s against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, don''t you think? Why didn''t I see it before?" " What are you talking about?" said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn''t answer. Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl. " Hullo," he said, smiling. " Finished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?" " Yes, please," said Ron, but Harry cut him off. " No, we''re in a hurry. Hagrid, I''ve got to ask you something. You know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?" " Dunno," said Hagrid casually, "he wouldn'' take his cloak off." He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows. " It''s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o'' funny folk in the Hog''s Head -- that''s the pub down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn'' he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up." Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas. " What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?" " Mighta come up," said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember. " Yeah... he asked what I did, an'' I told him I was gamekeeper here.... He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after... so I told him... an'' I said what I''d always really wanted was a dragon... an'' then... I can'' remember too well, ''cause he kept buyin'' me drinks.... Let''s see... yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an'' we could play cards fer it if I wanted... but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn'' want it ter go ter any old home.... So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy..." "And did he -- did he seem interested in Fluffy?" Harry asked, try ing to keep his voice calm. " Well -- yeah -- how many three-headed dogs d''yeh meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy''s a piece o'' cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus'' play him a bit o'' music an'' he''ll go straight off ter sleep --" Hagrid suddenly looked horrified. " I shouldn''ta told yeh that!" he blurted out. " Forget I said it! Hey -- where''re yeh goin''?" Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn''t speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds. " We''ve got to go to Dumbledore," said Harry. " Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak -- it must''ve been easy, once he''d got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn''t stop him. Where''s Dumbledore''s office?" They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him. " We''ll just have to --" Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall. " What are you three doing inside?" It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books. " We want to see Professor Dumbledore," said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought. " See Professor Dumbledore?" Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. " Why?" Harry swallowed -- now what?

" He''s gone?" said Harry frantically. " Now?" " Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time -- "But this is important." " Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter. " Look," said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, "Professor -- it''s about the Sorcerer''s tone --" Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn''t that. The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn''t pick them up. " How do you know --?" she spluttered. " Professor, I think -- I know -- that Sn- that someone''s going to try and steal the Stone. I''ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore." She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion. " Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow," she said finally. I don''t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it''s too well protected." " But Professor --" "Potter, I know what I''m talking about," she said shortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen books. I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine." But they didn''t. " It''s tonight," said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot. " Snape''s going through the trapdoor tonight. He''s found out everything he needs, and now he''s got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up." " But what can we --" Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round. Snape was standing there. " Good afternoon," he said smoothly. They stared at him. " You shouldn''t be inside on a day like this," he said, with an odd, twisted smile. " We were --" Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say. " You want to be more careful," said Snape. " Hanging around like this, people will think you''re up to something. And Gryffindor really can''t afford to lose any more points, can it?" Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back. " Be warned, Potter -- any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you." He strode off in the direction of the staffroom. Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others. " Right, here''s what we''ve got to do," he whispered urgently. " One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape -- wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you''d better do that." " Why me?" " It''s obvious," said Ron. " You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know." He put on a high voice, "''Oh Professor Flitwick, I''m so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong....''" "Oh, shut up," said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape. " And we''d better stay outside the third-floor corridor," Harry told Ron. " Come on." But that part of the plan didn''t work. No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper. " I suppose you think you''re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!" she stormed. " Enough of this nonsense! If I hear you ''ve come anywhere near here again, I''ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own house!" Harry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, "At least Hermione''s on Snape''s tail," when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in. " I''m sorry, Harry!" she wailed. " Snape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I''ve only just got away, I don''t know where Snape went." " Well, that''s it then, isn''t it?" Harry said. The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering. " I''m going out of here tonight and I''m going to try and get to the Stone first." " You''re mad!" said Ron. " You can''t!" said Hermione. " After what McGonagall and Snape have said?

Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn''t been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn''t talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do. Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed. " Better get the cloak," Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He putted out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy -- he didn''t feel much like singing. He ran back down to the common room. " We''d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us -- if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own --" "What are you doing?" said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he''d been making another bid for freedom. " Nothing, Neville, nothing," said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back. Neville stared at their guilty faces. " You''re going out again," he said. " No, no, no," said Hermione. " No, we''re not. Why don''t you go to bed, Neville?" Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn''t afford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep. " You can''t go out," said Neville, "you''ll be caught again. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble." " You don''t understand," said Harry, "this is important." But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate. I won''t let you do it," he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole. " I''ll -- I''ll fight you!" " Neville, "Ron exploded, "get away from that hole and don''t be an idiot --" "Don''t you call me an idiot!" said Neville. I don''t think you should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!" " Yes, but not to us," said Ron in exasperation. " Neville, you don''t know what you''re doing." He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight. " Go on then, try and hit me!" said Neville, raising his fists. " I''m ready!" Harry turned to Hermione. " Do something," he said desperately. Hermione stepped forward. " Neville," she said, "I''m really, really sorry about this." She raised her wand. " Petrificus Totalus!" she cried, pointing it at Neville. Neville''s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole bod', NULL);

Neville''s jaws were jammed together so he couldn''t speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror. " What''ve you done to him?" Harry whispered. " It''s the full Body-Bind," said Hermione miserably. " Oh, Neville, I''m so sorry." " We had to, Neville, no time to explain," said Harry. " You''ll understand later, Neville," said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak. But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn''t feel like a very good omen. In their nervous state, every statue''s shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them. At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top. " Oh, let''s kick her, just this once," Ron whispered in Harry''s ear, but Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn''t do anything. They didn''t meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip. " Who''s there?" he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes. " Know you''re there, even if I can''t see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?" He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them. " Should call Filch, I should, if something''s a-creeping around unseen." Harry had a sudden idea. " Peeves," he said, in a hoarse whisper, "the Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible." Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs. " So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir," he said greasily. " My mistake, my mistake -- I didn''t see you -- of course I didn''t, you''re invisible -- forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir." " I have business here, Peeves," croaked Harry. " Stay away from this place tonight." " I will, sir, I most certainly will," said Peeves, rising up in the air again. " Hope your business goes well, Baron, I''ll not bother you." And he scooted off "Brilliant, Harry!" whispered Ron. A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor -- and the door was already ajar. " Well, there you are," Harry said quietly, "Snape''s already got past Fluffy." Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two. " If you want to go back, I won''t blame you," he said. " You can take the cloak, I won''t need it now." " Don''t be stupid," said Ron. " We''re coming," said Hermione. Harry pushed the door open. As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the dog''s noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn''t see them. " What''s that at its feet?" Hermione whispered. " Looks like a harp," said Ron. " Snape must have left it there." " It must wake up the moment you stop playing," said Harry. " Well, here goes..." He put Hagrid''s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn''t really a tune, but from the first note the beast''s eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dog''s growls ceased -- it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep. " Keep playing," Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog''s hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads. " I think we''ll be able to pull the door open," said Ron, peering over the dog''s back. " Want to go first, Hermione?" " No, I don''t!" " All right." Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog''s legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open. " What can you see?" Hermione said anxiously. " Nothing -- just black -- there''s no way of climbing down, we''ll just have to drop." Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself. " You want to go ', NULL);

Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds'' silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep. Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom. He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, "If anything happens to me, don''t follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?" " Right," said Ron. " See you in a minute, I hope... And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and -- FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant. " It''s okay!" he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, "it''s a soft landing, you can jump!" Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry. " What''s this stuff?" were his first words. " Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it''s here to break the fall. Come on, Hermione!" The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry''s other side. " We must be miles under the school , she said. " Lucky this plant thing''s here, really," said Ron. " Lucky!" shrieked Hermione. " Look at you both!" She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing. Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them. " Stop moving!" Hermione ordered them. " I know what this is -- it''s Devil''s Snare!" " Oh, I''m so glad we know what it''s called, that''s a great help," snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. " Shut up, I''m trying to remember how to kill it!" said Hermione. " Well, hurry up, I can''t breathe!" Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest. " Devil''s Snare, Devil''s Snare... what did Professor Sprout say? -- it likes the dark and the damp "So light a fire!" Harry choked. " Yes -- of course -- but there''s no wood!" Hermione cried, wringing her hands. " HAVE YOU GONE MAD?" Ron bellowed. " ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?" " Oh, right!" said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free. " Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione," said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face. " Yeah," said Ron, "and lucky Harry doesn''t lose his head in a crisis -- ''there''s no wood,'' honestly." " This way," said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward. All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards'' bank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon -- Norbert had been bad enough... "Can you hear something?" Ron whispered. Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead. " Do you think it''s a ghost?" " I don''t know... sounds like wings to me." " There''s light ahead -- I can see something moving." They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a br', NULL);

On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door. " Do you think they''ll attack us if we cross the room?" said Ron. " Probably," said Harry. " They don''t look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once... well, there''s no other choice... I''ll run." He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked. The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn''t budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm. " Now what?" said Ron. " These birds... they can''t be here just for decoration," said Hermione. They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering -- glittering? " They''re not birds!" Harry said suddenly. " They''re keys! Winged keys -- look carefully. So that must mean..." he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. " ... yes -- look! Broomsticks! We''ve got to catch the key to the door!" " But there are hundreds of them!" Ron examined the lock on the door. " We''re looking for a big, old-fashioned one -- probably silver, like the handle." They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one. Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn''t. After a minute''s weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole. " That one!" he called to the others. " That big one -- there -- no, there -- with bright blue wings -- the feathers are all crumpled on one side." Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom. " We''ve got to close in on it!" Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing. " Ron, you come at it from above -- Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down and I''ll try and catch it. Right, NOW!" Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. Ron and Hermione''s cheers echoed around the high chamber. They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned -- it worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice. " Ready?" Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open. The next chamber was so dark they couldn''t see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight. They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly -- the towering white chessmen had no faces. " Now what do we do?" Harry whispered. " It''s obvious, isn''t it?" said Ron. " We''ve got to play our way across the room." Behind the white pieces they could see another door. " How?" said Hermione nervously. " I think," said Ron, "we''re going to have to be chessmen." He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight''s horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron. " Do we -- er -- have to join you to get across?" The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other tw', NULL);

Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said, "Now, don''t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess --" "We''re not offended," said Harry quickly. " Just tell us what to do." " Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, YOU 90 next to him instead of that castle." " What about you?" " I''m going to be a knight," said Ron. The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took. " White always plays first in chess," said Ron, peering across the board. " Yes... look..." A white pawn had moved forward two squares. Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Harry''s knees were trembling. What if they lost? " Harry -- move diagonally four squares to the right." Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown. " Had to let that happen," said Ron, looking shaken. " Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on." Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones. " We''re nearly there," he muttered suddenly. " Let me think let me think..." The white queen turned her blank face toward him. " Yes..." said Ron softly, "It''s the only way... I''ve got to be taken." " NOF Harry and Hermione shouted. " That''s chess!" snapped Ron. " You''ve got to make some sacrifices! I take one step forward and she''ll take me -- that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!" " But --" "Do you want to stop Snape or not?" " Ron --" "Look, if you don''t hurry up, he''ll already have the Stone!" There was no alternative. " Ready?" Ron called, his face pale but determined. " Here I go - now, don''t hang around once you''ve won." He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor - Hermione screamed but stayed on her square - the white queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he''d been knocked out. Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left. The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry''s feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway. " What if he''s --?" " He''ll be all right," said Harry, trying to convince himself. " What do you reckon''s next?" " We''ve had Sprout''s, that was the Devil''s Snare; Flitwick must''ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell''s spell, and Snape''s." They had reached another door. " All right?" Harry whispered. " Go on." Harry pushed it open. A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head. " I''m glad we didn''t have to fight that one," Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. " Come on, I can''t breathe." He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next - but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line. " Snape''s," said Harry. " What do we have to do?" They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn''t ordinary fire either; it was purple.

At last, she clapped her hands. \" Got it,\" she said. \" The smallest bottle will get us through the black fire -- toward the Stone.\" Harry looked at the tiny bottle. \" There''s only enough there for one of us,\" he said. \" That''s hardly one swallow.\" They looked at each other. \" Which one will get you back through the purple flames?\" Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line. \" You drink that,\" said Harry. \" No, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab brooms from the flying- key room, they''ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy -- go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him.

Quirrell laughed, and it wasn''t his usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp. " Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn''t he? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?" Harry couldn''t take it in. This couldn''t be true, it couldn''t. " But Snape tried to kill me!" " No, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I''d have got you off that broom. I''d have managed it before then if Snape hadn''t been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you." " Snape was trying to save me?" " Of course," said Quirrell coolly. " \Why do you think he wanted to referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn''t do it again. Funny, really... he needn''t have bothered. I couldn''t do anything with Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular... and what a waste of time, when after all that, I''m going to kill you tonight." Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry. " You''re too nosy to live, Potter.

I have a special gift with trolls -- you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off -- and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn''t even manage to bite Snape''s leg off properly. " Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror. It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised. " This mirror is the key to finding the Stone," Quirrell murmured, tapping his way around the frame. " Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this... but he''s in London... I''ll be far away by the time he gets back...." All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror. " I saw you and Snape in the forest --" he blurted out. " Yes," said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back. " He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I''d got. He suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me - as though he could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side...." Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it. " I see the Stone... I''m presenting it to my master... but where is it?" Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn''t give. He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror. " But Snape always seemed to hate me so much." " Oh, he does," said Quirrell casually, "heavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts with your father, didn''t you know? They loathed each other. But he never wanted you dead." " But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing -- I thought Snape was threatening you...." For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell''s face. " Sometimes," he said, "I find it hard to follow my master''s instructions -- he is a great wizard and I am weak --" "You mean he was there in the classroom with you?" Harry gasped. " He is with me wherever I go," said Quirrell quietly. " I met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it.... Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me." Quirrell shivered suddenly. " He does not forgive mistake', NULL);

He punished me... decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me...." Quirrell''s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley -how could he have been so stupid? He''d seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron. Quirrell cursed under his breath. " I don''t understand... is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?" Harry''s mind was racing. What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see myseff finding it -- which means I''ll see where it''s hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I''m up to? He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to himself. " What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!" And to Harry''s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself "Use the boy... Use the boy..." Quirrell rounded on Harry. " Yes -- Potter -- come here." He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry got slowly to his feet. " Come here," Quirrell repeated. " Look in the mirror and tell me what you see." Harry walked toward him. I must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie about what I see, that''s all. Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell''s turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again. He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket -- and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket. Somehow -- incredibly -- he''d gotten the Stone. " Well?" said Quirrell impatiently. " What do you see?" Harry screwed up his courage. " I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore," he invented. " I -- I''ve won the house cup for Gryffindor." Quirrell cursed again. " Get out of the way," he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the Sorcerer''s Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it? But he hadn''t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn''t moving his lips. " He lies... He lies..." "Potter, come back here!" Quirrell shouted. " Tell me the truth! What did you just see?" The high voice spoke again. " Let me speak to him... face-to-face..." "Master, you are not strong enough!" " I have strength enough... for this...." Harry felt as if Devil''s Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn''t move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell''s head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the spot. Harry would have screamed, but he couldn''t make a sound. Where there should have been a back to Quirrell''s head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake. " Harry Potter..." it whispered. Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn''t move. " See what I have become?" the face said. " Mere shadow and vapor ... I have form only when I can share another''s body... but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds.... Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks... you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest... and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to create a body of my own.... Now... why don''t you give me that Stone in your pocket?" So he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry''s legs. He stumbled backward. " Don''t be a fool," snarled the face. " Better save your own life and join me... or you''ll meet the same end as your parents.... They died begging me ', NULL);
INSERT INTO SYSTEM_LOB_STREAM VALUES(4, 102, 'for mercy..." "LIAR!" Harry shouted suddenly. Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see him. The evil face was now smiling. " How touching..." it hissed. " I always value bravery... Yes, boy, your parents were brave.... I killed your father first; and he put up a courageous fight... but your mother needn''t have died... she was trying to protect you.... Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain." " NEVER!" Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed "SEIZE HIM!" and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell''s hand close on his wrist. At once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry''s scar; his head felt as though it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head lessened -- he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers -- they were blistering before his eyes. " Seize him! SEIZE HIM!" shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet'' landing on top of him, both hands around Harry''s neck -- Harry''s scar was almost blinding him with pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony. " Master, I cannot hold him -- my hands -- my hands!" And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms -- Harry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny. " Then kill him, fool, and be done!" screeched Voldemort. Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell''s face -- "AAAARGH!" Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn''t touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain -- his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse. Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off -- the pain in Harry''s head was building -- he couldn''t see -- he could only hear Quirrell''s terrible shrieks and Voldemort''s yells of, "KILL HIM! KILL HIM!" and other voices, maybe in Harry''s own head, crying, "Harry! Harry!" He felt Quirrell''s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down ... down... down... Something gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too heavy. He blinked. It wasn''t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How strange. He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above him. " Good afternoon, Harry," said Dumbledore. Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: "Sir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! He''s got the Stone! Sir, quick --" "Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times," said Dumbledore. " Quirrell does not have the Stone." " Then who does? Sir, I --" "Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out. Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop. " Tokens from your friends and admirers," said Dumbledore, beaming. " What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it." " How long have I been in here?" " Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried." " But sit, the Stone I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say. " You got there? You got Hermione''s o', NULL);
INSERT INTO SYSTEM_LOB_STREAM VALUES(4, 103, 'wl?" " We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you." " It was you." " I feared I might be too late." " You nearly were, I couldn''t have kept him off the Stone much longer --" "Not the Stone, boy, you -- the effort involved nearly killed you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed." " Destroyed?" said Harry blankly. " But your friend -- Nicolas Flamel --" "Oh, you know about Nicolas?" said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted. " You did do the thing properly, didn''t you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it''s all for the best." " But that means he and his wife will die, won''t they?" " They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes, they will die." Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry''s face. " To one as young as you, I''m sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above all -- the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them." Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling. " Sir?" said Harry. " I''ve been thinking... sir -- even if the Stone''s gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know- Who --" "Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself." " Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort''s going to try other ways of coming back, isn''t he? I mean, he hasn''t gone, has he?" " No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share... not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time -- and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power." Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then he said, "Sir, there are some other things I''d like to know, if you can tell me... things I want to know the truth about...." "The truth." Dumbledore sighed. " It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you''ll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie." " Well... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the first place?" Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time. " Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not now. You will know, one day... put it from your mind for now, Harry. When you are older... I know you hate to hear this... when you are ready, you will know." And Harry knew it would be no good to argue. " But why couldn''t Quirrell touch me?" " Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn''t realize that love as powerful as your mother''s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign... to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good." Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice again, Harry said, "And the invisibility cloak - do you know who sent it to ', NULL);
INSERT INTO SYSTEM_LOB_STREAM VALUES(4, 104, 'me?" " Ah - your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it." Dumbledore''s eyes twinkled. " Useful things... your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here." " And there''s something else..." "Fire away." " Quirrell said Snape --" "Professor Snape, Harry." " Yes, him -- Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father. Is that true?" " Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive." " What?" " He saved his life." " What?" " Yes..." said Dumbledore dreamily. " Funny, the way people''s minds work, isn''t it? Professor Snape couldn''t bear being in your father''s debt.... I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even. Then he could go back to hating your father''s memory in peace...." Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped. " And sir, there''s one more thing..." "Just the one?" " How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?" " Ah, now, I''m glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that''s saying something. You see, only one who wanted to find the Stone -- find it, but not use it -- would be able to get it, otherwise they''d just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My brain surprises even me sometimes.... Now, enough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bettie Bott''s Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomitflavored one, and since then I''m afraid I''ve rather lost my liking for them -- but I think I''ll be safe with a nice toffee, don''t you?" He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then he choked and said, "Alas! Ear wax!" Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict. " Just five minutes," Harry pleaded. " Absolutely not." " You let Professor Dumbledore in..." "Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need rest." " I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam Pomfrey..." "Oh, very well," she said. " But five minutes only." And she let Ron and Hermione in. " Harry!" Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore. " Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to -- Dumbledore was so worried --" "The whole school''s talking about it," said Ron. " What really happened?" It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell''s turban, Hermione screamed out loud. " So the Stone''s gone?" said Ron finally. " Flamel''s just going to die?" " That''s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that -- what was it? -- ''to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. " I always said he was off his rocker," said Ron, looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was. " So what happened to you two?" said Harry. " Well, I got back all right," said Hermione. " I brought Ron round -- that took a while -- and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall -- he already knew -- he just said, ''Harry''s gone after him, hasn''t he?'' and hurtled off to the third floor." " D''you think he meant you to do it?" said Ron. " Sending you your father''s cloak and everything?" " Well, " Hermione exploded, "if he did -- I mean to say that''s terrible -- you could have been killed." " No, it isn''t," said Harry thoughtfully. " He''s a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don''t think it was an accident he let', NULL);

"Yeah, Dumbledore''s off his rocker, all right," said Ron proudly. " Listen, you''ve got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course -- you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you -- but the food''ll be good." At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over. " You''ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT" she said firmly. After a good night''s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal. I want to go to the feast," he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes. I can, can''t I?" " Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go," she said stiffily, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn''t realize how risky feasts could be. " And you have another visitor." " Oh, good," said Harry. " Who is it?" Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to Harry, took one look at him, and burst into tears. " It''s -- all -- my -- ruddy -- fault!" he sobbed, his face in his hands. I told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only thing he didn''t know, an'' I told him! Yeh could''ve died! All fer a dragon egg! I''ll never drink again! I should be chucked out an'' made ter live as a Muggle!" " Hagrid!" said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. " Hagrid, he''d have found out somehow, this is Voldemort we''re talking about, he''d have found out even if you hadn''t told him." " Yeh could''ve died!" sobbed Hagrid. " An'' don'' say the name!" " VOLDEMORT!" Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he stopped crying. " I''ve met him and I''m calling him by his name. Please cheer up, Hagrid, we saved the Stone, it''s gone, he can''t use it. Have a Chocolate Frog, I''ve got loads...." Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, "That reminds me. I''ve got yeh a present." " It''s not a stoat sandwich, is it?" said Harry anxiously, and at last Hagrid gave a weak chuckle. " Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it. '' Course, he shoulda sacked me instead -- anyway, got yeh this..." It seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. Harry opened it curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father. " Sent owls off ter all yer parents'' old school friends, askin'' fer photos... knew yeh didn'' have any... d''yeh like it?" Harry couldn''t speak, but Hagrid understood. Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night. He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey''s fussing about, insisting on giving him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin''s winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table. When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him. Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away. " Another year gone!" Dumbledore said cheerfully. " And I must trouble you with an old man''s wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were... you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts.... "Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy- two."

" However, recent events must be taken into account." The room went very still. The Slytherins'' smiles faded a little. " Ahem," said Dumbledore. " I have a few last-minute points to dish out. Let me see. Yes... "First -- to Mr. Ronald Weasley..." Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn. " ...for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points." Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, "My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall''s giant chess set!" At last there was silence again. " Second -- to Miss Hermione Granger... for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points." Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves -- they were a hundred points up. " Third -- to Mr. Harry Potter..." said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points." The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points -- exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup -- if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point. Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent. " There are all kinds of courage," said Dumbledore, smiling. " It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom." Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn''t have looked more stunned and horrified if he''d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him. " Which means, Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, "we need a little change of decoration." He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall''s hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry''s eye and Harry knew at once that Snape''s feelings toward him hadn''t changed one jot. This didn''t worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts. It was the best evening of Harry''s life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls... he would never, ever forget tonight. Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn''t have everything in life. And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville''s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays ("I always hope they''ll forget to give us these," said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; t', NULL);

Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn''t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley''s sister, but they hadn''t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn''t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him.

At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. \" Little tyke,\" chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four''s drive. It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn''t realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn''t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats couldn''t read maps or signs.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"1#3\" wordCount=\"278\" sentimentScore=\"-0.0695\" fkGrade=\"6.738277012932837\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.00423049645390071\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.005014184397163121\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.0055106382978723405\"/>\n            <Body>Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day. But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn''t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn''t bear people who dressed in funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren''t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something... yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills. Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn''t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn''t see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"1#4\" wordCount=\"254\" sentimentScore=\"-0.4183529411764706\" fkGrade=\"5.888754789272031\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.005015'), NULL);

Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he''d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery. He''d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker''s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn''t know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn''t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying. \" The Potters, that''s right, that''s what I heard yes, their son, Harry\" Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it. He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn''t such an unusual name.

He didn''t blame her -- if he''d had a sister like that... but all the same, those people in cloaks... He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o''clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door. \" Sorry,\" he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn''t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \"Don''t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day! \" And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off. Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled.

It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife. Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door''s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (\"Won''t!\") . Mr. Dursley tried to act normally.

Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters... Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He''d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. \" Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven''t heard from your sister lately, have you?\" As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn''t have a sister. \" No,\" she said sharply. \" Why?\" \" Funny stuff on the news,\" Mr. Dursley mumbled. \" Owls... shooting stars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today...\" \"So?\" snapped Mrs. Dursley. \" Well, I just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you know... her crowd.\" Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips.

It didn''t so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all. A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you''d have thought he''d just popped out of the ground. The cat''s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed. Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man''s name was Albus Dumbledore. Albus Dumbledore didn''t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something.

Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley''s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley''s favorite sport: Harry Hunting. This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn''t be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon''s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny. \" They stuff people''s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,\" he told Harry. \" Want to come upstairs and practice?\" \" No, thanks,\" said Harry. \" The poor toilet''s never had anything as horrible as your head down it -- it might be sick.\"</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"3#2\" wordCount=\"253\" sentimentScore=\"-0.29764705882352943\" fkGrade=\"6.9045577009429735\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.011920152091254754\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.0108745247148289\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.010159695817490495\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.00879087452471483\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.009186311787072245\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.014136882129277566\"/>\n            <Body>Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he''d said. One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg''s. Mrs. Figg wasn ''t as bad as usual. It turned out she''d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn''t seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she''d had it for several years. That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings'' boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren''t looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life. As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn''t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn''t trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh. There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look.

Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake: Mr. H. Potter The Cupboard under the Stairs 4 Privet Drive Little Whinging Surrey The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp. Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H. \"Hurry up, boy!\" shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. \" What are you doing, checking for letter bombs?\" He chuckled at his own joke. Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope.

Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering.... They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table. \"'' Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter?

Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house. The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms. Uncle Vernon''s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas.

Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop). Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry''s list again. \" Just yer wand left - A yeah, an'' I still haven''t got yeh a birthday present.\"</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"5#21\" wordCount=\"275\" sentimentScore=\"0.05789473684210526\" fkGrade=\"6.8086119133573995\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.006231046931407943\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.0038339350180505417\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.0062671480144404325\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.013191335740072202\"/>\n            <Body>Harry felt himself go red. \" You don''t have to --\" \"I know I don''t have to.

He couldn''t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell. \" Don'' mention it,\" said Hagrid gruffly. \" Don'' expect you''ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now - only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand. \" A magic wand... this was what Harry had been really looking forward to. The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window. A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"5#22\" wordCount=\"251\" sentimentScore=\"0.03585'), NULL);

Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while.

Two hours later, Harry''s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys'' car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off. They reached King''s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry''s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him.

He stopped a passing guard, but didn''t dare mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn''t even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o''clock, but the guard said there wasn''t one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl. Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector''s stand between platforms nine and ten. At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying. \" -- packed with Muggles, of course --\" Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair.

All right, Percy, you go first. \" What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten. Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it -- but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished. \" Fred, you next,\" the plump woman said. \" I''m not Fred, I''m George,\" said the boy. \" Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? CarA you tell I''m George? \" \" Sorry, George, dear. \" \" Only joking, I am Fred,\" said the boy, and off he went.

Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks. The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, \"Gran, I''ve lost my toad again.\" \" Oh, Neville,\" he heard the old woman sigh. A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd. \" Give us a look, Lee, go on.\" The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.

It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood. \" Heads down!\" yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles. \" Oy, you there! Is this your toad? \" said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them. \" Trevor! \" cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid''s lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.

The hat seemed to be asking rather alot; Harry didn''t feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment.

The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell''s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he''d met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days.

Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps. Hedwig hadn''t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls.

He complained loudly about first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn''t the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he''d spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who''d listen about the time he''d almost hit a hang glider on Charlie''s old broom. Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly.

Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she''d had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground. Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. This was something you couldn''t learn by heart out of a book -- not that she hadn''t tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she''d gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione''s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail. Harry hadn''t had a single letter since Hagrid''s note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy''s eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table. A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke. \" It''s a Remembrall!\"</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"9#3\" wordCount=\"257\" sentimentScore=\"-0.23723076923076925\" fkGrade=\"8.360635658914727\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.008449612403100774\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.007089147286821705\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.013337209302325582\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.016286821705426356\"/>\n            <Body>he explained. \" Gran knows I forget things -- this tells you if th'), NULL);

Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfay, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash. \" What''s going on?\" \" Malfoy''s got my Remembrall, Professor.\" Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table. \" Just looking,\" he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him. At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance. The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground.

Harry''s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger''s had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville''s hadn''t moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville''s voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground. Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he''d been doing it wrong for years. \" Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,\" said Madam Hooch. \" Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly.

Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection. \" It''s either really valuable or really dangerous,\" said Ron. \" Or both,\" said Harry. But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn''t have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues. Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again. Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later. As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone''s attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls.

Ron, at the next table, wasn''t having much more luck. \" Wingardium Leviosa!\" he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill. \" You''re saying it wrong,\" Harry heard Hermione snap. \" It''s Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the ''gar'' nice and long.\"</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"10#10\" wordCount=\"255\" sentimentScore=\"-0.053684210526315786\" fkGrade=\"5.227663823590596\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.005122047244094488\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.004736220472440944\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.015842519685039372\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.006704724409448818\"/>\n            <Body>\" You do it, then, if you''re so clever,\" Ron snarled.

It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face -- and was startled to see that she was in tears. \" I think she heard you.\" \" So?\" said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. \" She must''ve noticed she''s got no friends.\" Hermione didn''t turn up for the next class and wasn''t seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls'' bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds. A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"10#11\" wordCount=\"268\" sentimentScore=\"-0.07940740740740741\" fkGrade=\"5.910940170940172\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.00988593155893536\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.013752851711026618\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.015209125475285171\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.005996197718631179\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.0076045627376425'), NULL);

Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore''s chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, \"Troll -- in the dungeons -- thought you ought to know.\" He then sank to the floor in a dead faint. There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore''s wand to bring silence. \" Prefects,\" he rumbled, \"lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!\" Percy was in his element. \" Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming through! Excuse me, I''m a prefect! \" \" How could a troll get in? \" Harry asked as they climbed the stairs. \" Don''t ask me, they''re supposed to be really stupid,\" said Ron. \" Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke. \" They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron''s arm. \" I''ve just thought -- Hermione.\" \" What about her?\" \" She doesn''t know about the troll.\" Ron bit his lip. \" Oh, all right,\" he snapped. \" But Percy''d better not see us.\" Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls'' bathroom.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"10#12\" wordCount=\"252\" sentimentScore=\"-0.36654545454545456\" fkGrade=\"5.318191019506809\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.011266129032258062\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.008221774193548389\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.01363709677419355\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.005669354838709677\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.006362903225806451\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.011967741935483871\"/>\n            <Body>They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them. \" Percy!\" hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.

And then they heard it -- a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed -- at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight. It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long. The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"10#13\" wordCount=\"254\" sentimentScore=\"-0.13854545454545453\" fkGrade=\"4.114143070044712\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.019495901639344265\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.008516393442622953\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.004422131147540984\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.02106967213114754\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.0064959016393442625\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sur'), NULL);

They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn''t about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it. '' Yes! \" Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop -- a high, petrified scream -- and it was coming from the chamber they''d just chained up. \" Oh, no,\" said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron. \" It''s the girls'' bathroom! \" Harry gasped. \" Hermione! \" they said together. It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside. Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went. \" Confuse it!\" Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall. The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione.

It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went. \" Oy, pea-brain!\" yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn''t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it. \" Come on, run, run!\" Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn''t move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror. The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape. Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll''s neck from behind. The troll couldn''t feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry''s wand had still been in his hand when he''d jumped -- it had gone straight up one of the troll''s nostrils. Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club.

The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble. Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done. It was Hermione who spoke first. \" Is it -- dead?\" I don''t think so,\" said Harry, I think it''s just been knocked out.\" He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll''s nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue. \" Urgh -- troll boogers.\" He wiped it on the troll''s trousers. A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up. They hadn''t realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll''s roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart. Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry.

Harry looked at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down. Then a small voice came out of the shadows. \" Please, Professor McGonagall -- they were looking for me.\" \" Miss Granger!\" Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last. I went looking for the troll because I -- I thought I could deal with it on my own -- you know, because I''ve read all about them. \" Ron dropped his wand.

The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots. The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house championship. Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn''t know which was worse -- people telling him he''d be brilliant or people telling him they''d be running around underneath him holding a mattress. It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermlone as a friend. He didn''t know how he''d have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also tent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read. Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"11#2\" wordCount=\"252\" sentimentScore=\"-0.288\" fkGrade=\"4.499875776397516\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.016287401574803153\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.004519685039370079\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.012988188976377954\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.015188976377952754\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.005318897637795275\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.006460629921259843\"/>\n            <Body>Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it.

Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it. \" Better you than me,\" they said together, but Harry had an idea that Snape wouldn''t refuse if there were other teachers listening. He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no answer. He knocked again. Nothing. Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He pushed the door ajar and peered inside -- and a horrible scene met his eyes. Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape bandages. \" Blasted thing*,\" Snape was saying. \" How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?\" Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but -- \"POTTER!\" Snape''s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg.

A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below -- Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry''s broom spun off course, Harry holding on for dear life. \" Foul!\" screamed the Gryffindors. Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again. Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, \"Send him off, ref! Red card! \" \" What are you talking about, Dean? \" said Ron. \" Red card! \" said Dean furiously. \" In soccer you get shown the red card and you''re out of the game! \" \" But this isn''t soccer, Dean,\" Ron reminded him.

Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; she didn''t even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front. Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few, well- chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape''s robes.

One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again. No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape''s classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons. \" I do feel so sorry,\" said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, \"for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they''re not wanted at home.\" He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he''d realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"12#2\" wordCount=\"251\" sentimentScore=\"-0.33466666666666667\" fkGrade=\"6.430986394557827\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.008080645161290322\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.004193548387096774\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.006427419354838709\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fe'), NULL);

He didn''t feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas he''d ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie. When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it. \" Hi, Hagrid, want any help?\" Ron asked, sticking his head through the branches. \" Nah, I''m all right, thanks, Ron.\" \" Would you mind moving out of the way?\" came Malfoys cold drawl from behind them. \" Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley?

Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn''t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he''d never get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts. \" What are you looking for, boy?\" \" Nothing,\" said Harry. Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him. \" You''d better get out, then. Go on -- out! \" Wishing he''d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they''d better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she''d be able to tell them, but they couldn''t risk Snape hearing what they were up to. Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn''t very hopeful.

Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork -- bread, English muffins, marshmallows -- and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn''t work. Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle. Ron''s set was very old and battered. Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family -- in this case, his grandfather.

Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry''s amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided. When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set. The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. Norris''s Christmas dinner.

The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps. The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Step ping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles. They didn''t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn''t understand. Some had no title at all. One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back of Harry''s neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn''t be. He had to start somewhere.

They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in. It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket -- but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn''t look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way.

Right, we''re changin'' groups -- Neville, you stay with me an'' Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an'' this idiot. I''m sorry,\" Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry, \"but he''ll have a harder time frightenin'' you, an'' we''ve gotta get this done. \" So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak. \" Look --\" he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy. Something bright white was gleaming on the ground.

Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves. Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered.... Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal''s side, and began to drink its blood. \" AAAAAAAAAARGH!\" Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted -- so did Fang. The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry -- unicorn blood was dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry -- he couldn''t move for fear. Then a pain like he''d never felt before pierced his head; it was as though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure. The pain in Harry''s head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white-blond hair and a palomino body. \" Are you all right?\"</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"15#17\" wordCount=\"255\" sentimentScore=\"-0.068\" fkGrade=\"3.722223628691985\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.021483193277310922\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.01476890756302521\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.009134453781512604\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.010995798319327729\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.007058823529411764\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.012138655462184877\"/>\n            <Body>said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet. \" Yes -- thank you -- what was that?\" The centaur didn''t answer.

Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were... you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts.... \"Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy- two.\" A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table.

Yes... \"First -- to Mr. Ronald Weasley...\" Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn. \" ...for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\" Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, \"My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall''s giant chess set! \" At last there was silence again. \" Second -- to Miss Hermione Granger... for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points. \" Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves -- they were a hundred points up. \" Third -- to Mr. Harry Potter...\" said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points. \" The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points -- exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup -- if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"17#20\" wordCount=\"259\" sentimentScore=\"-0.06475\" fkGrade=\"7.899186776061775\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.014988549618320612\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.014324427480916032\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.007751908396946565\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.036087786259541975\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.013496183206106868\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.021469465648854963\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.017381679389312978\"/>\n            <Body>Dumbledore raised his hand.

I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom. \" Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn''t have looked more stunned and horrified if he''d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him. \" Which means, Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, \"we need a little change of decoration. \" He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall''s hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry''s eye and Harry knew at once that Snape''s feelings toward him hadn''t changed one jot. This didn''t worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"17#21\" wordCount=\"285\" sentimentScore=\"-0.12666666666666665\" fkGrade=\"11.849858131487888\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.004341296928327645\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.01018430034129693\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.0034641638225255977\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.009013651877133105\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.012938566552901026\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.014532423208191127\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.01308873720136519\"/>\n            <Body>It was the best evening of Harry''s life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls... he would never, ever forget tonight. Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn''t have everything in life. And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville''s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays (\"I always hope they''ll forget to give us these,\" said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bettie Bott''s Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King''s Cross Station. It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn''t attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles.</Body>\n        </Block>\n        <Block id=\"17#22\" wordCount=\"250\" sentimentScore=\"0.03333333333333333\" fkGrade=\"3.4149079497907984\">\n            <Emotion type=\"anger\" score=\"0.011771784232365148\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"anticipation\" score=\"0.006029045643153526\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"disgust\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"fear\" score=\"0.004601659751037344\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"sadness\" score=\"0.00724896265560166\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"surprise\" score=\"0.0\"/>\n            <Emotion type=\"trust\" score=\"0.0138091286307053'), NULL);

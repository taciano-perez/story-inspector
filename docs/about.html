                <p>Hi there.
                <p>Let me tell you the tale of how Story Inspector came to be.
                <p>I'm a professional software engineer and amateur author. Around 2020 I finished the draft of my first novel, and shared it with a few friends. I discovered two things.
                <p>The first was that it sucked.
                <p>The second was that no one would read 80,000 words of poor writing for free in order to give me detailed feedback.
                <p>I wanted to improve my novel, but how? What were the weakest spots? What emotions did it elicit (if any)? Was it even telling the story I wanted to tell? After so many hours and hours of writing, and so many pages piling up, it was hard to tell the forest from the trees.
                <p>Being a software developer, I missed the writing equivalent of a code inspection tool, something I could use to analyze my draft and gather objective information about it. If only such a tool existed...
                <p>That's why I created Story Inspector. (Of course it was also a good excuse to procrastinate on my novel ðŸ˜‰)
                <p>I share it here, as free software, in hopes it will be useful for you too.
                <p>Have fun.
